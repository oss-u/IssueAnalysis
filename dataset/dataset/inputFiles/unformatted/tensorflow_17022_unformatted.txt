Ive been trying to install Tensorflow on my computer which currently runs python 3.7, however I keep running into some common issues... And each time i try to use the solutions provided, nothing works. 

Im not sure, but Im guessing python 3.7 might not be supported considering the official Tensorflow page has no link to python 3.7, that maybe this is the reason I havent been able to correctly install Tensorflow.Python 3.7 isn't eventually officially supported by Python. It's still in beta testing, and very much under active development.

For now, stick with Python 3.6.now，it's ok.Python 3.7 appears to be official now, ("final release" on June 27th).I don't think Python 3.7 support is ready yet. For homebrew users landing on this page, simply point to an older Formula file for Python.

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f2a764ef944b1080be64bd88dca9a1d80130c558/Formula/python.rb
```

I found this from https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commits/master/Formula/python.rb.I sill get
```shell
> pip3 install -U  tensorflow
Collecting tensorflow

great Fatima ,i need to check and try  i will get back and let you all know yeah, i am facing the same issues with python 3.7I am also facing same issues. I need a whl file of tensorflow-gpu. If anyone built it please mmail me to sukeshpabolu@gmail.comIs there an ETA for Python 3.7 support?Hello FatimaShahad, witch file did you get on the github? I found this list, but I don´t know witch file I have to download to follow your instruction... Can you help me?
By the way, I alread download the TensorFlow 0.12, that ramaakkantvdas recomended...

from there.Hello ciribellialvaro, I couldn't import tensorflow too so I download python 3.6 and everything is fine now@jaiken06 or anyone, how did you downgrade to python 3.6? I installed python with yum on an ec2 instance and couldn't figure out how to downgrade correctly please try using this link https://www.python.org/downloads/

or you might have to search it via google . i already had the installer file so hence i was saved of some worries . 

Tensorflow works fine in python 3.6 . i had issues in 3.7 hence downgraded . @ramaakkantvdas I'm running on an EC2 instance, so I can't use a download link :/ @AlexFine : i have no idea about AWS instances , please check with the support . i am working on windows .so i have installed on it . so yours must be Linux instances . you might have to check with python community forums as there you might be getting some answers . Hello Alex,

You can try unistall the python 3.7 on the control panel, then, download
the python 3.6 and install.

But, the lesson 234 of the course Machine Learng, I only did on the Visual
Studio Code...

Tks

I found this to work after searching for a while. I will leave this here as it might be useful for someone and save some time.

Tensorflow only supports Python 3.6 as of today. You can install a different version of python alongside your standard one. You need to:
- Download the Python3.6 tgz file from the official website (eg. Python-3.6.6.tgz)
- Unpack it with `tar -xvzf Python-3.6.6.tgz`
- `cd Python-3.6.6`
- run `./configure`
- run `make altinstall` to install it (`install` vs `altinstall` explanation here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16018463/difference-in-details-between-make-install-and-make-altinstall)

You'll normally find your new python install under `/usr/local/bin`. Now you can create a new virtualenv specifying the python version with:
- `virtualenv --python=python3.6 env3.6`
- Get into the virtualenv running the command `source env3.6/source/bin/activate`.
- Install tensorflow with the classic `pip install tensorflow`
- ProfitIs there a timeline yet for when TensorFlow will support 3.7 or if they are working towards it, or are we still in the dark?> Is there a timeline yet for when TensorFlow will support 3.7 or if they are working towards it, or are we still in the dark?

Sean , we found an work around for time being , Dont know when it would be supported or start working . For installation part this works: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl`

But on 3.7, post installaion you will face other issues, 
solved this one https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20690
but still stuck on this https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/21472
Will wait till tensorflow is installed via pip install tensorflow. Someone have to build it for linux as a wheel and udpate to pypi.org.For me worked to install Python3.6.4 and no later ... even 3.6.5 fails (and later of course).
Install Python3.6 from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ 
Works I have tried several ways finally downgraded to Python 3.6.6. Thank God, finally, tensorflow and keras installed successfully without any issues just by pip itself.

C:\Python36\Scripts>pip install keras
C:\Python36\Scripts>pip install tensorflow

Thanks for your info and comments regarding this issue guys. They were really helpful. Keep posting, Thanks once again.Perfect! 
I was frustrated as well till I found the solution.

please upvote.
And [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51235428/does-tensorflow-1-9-support-python-3-7/52783694#52783694) as well (just look for **Finally Worked for me!**)
Thanks!@nathaniel-lemonade The link you provided shows 3.6*. 
I can't downgrade cos I'm already using some features of 3.7 on my project. 

Any solution yet on this?I got the same issue with Python 3.7, I just use conda to reinstall tensorflow and keras dependencies. 
[https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/](url)

And it fix the problem : 

`conda install tensorflow keras`#Its python and tensorflow version compatibily issue on Windows 10

i have Uninstall existing tensorflow 

Use commnad:
conda install tensorflow keras

This itself degrade installed python version from 3.7 to 3.6.6 and tensorflow version 1.11.0

Now tensorflow works perfectly!! :)


>python
Python 3.6.6...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> print(tf.__version__)
1.11.0

It seems that this works on my system:
- Windows 10
- Python 3.7

Launching conda install tensorflow keras downgrade from python 3.7 to 3.6 and then install tensorflow.

Thanks!!!Hi everyone,

I solve the problem unistalling everything: Anaconda, Ptyhon, Spyder...
Restarted the laptop, installed the anaconda again, opened it, and then I
clicked on "environments" to install Theano, tensorflow, and Keras, in this
order.
After that, I restarted the lap top again, and everything worked.
but unfortunately, I recently changed my normal HD for an SSD, and my
windows is not accepting to install Anaconda!

In my case I created a new environment and then launch  "conda install tensorflow keras". Then everything worked fine.@lemillos thank you for answering me. Please, could you be more precise ? What I have to do step by step ? Install Conda package and then simply type on my cmd conda install tensorflow keras? What are you meaning for "create a new environment"? Do you mean a virtual environment? You would help me a lot, thank you anywayIm using Anaconda 5.3.1(released on 19th Nov, 2018) which by default installs python 3.7.0. 
But when i try to install keras , using **conda install -c conda-forge keras** ,
 it  is taking eternity to respond.
Also pip install keras aslo not working with python 3.7.0
conda install tensorflow  - not working
pip install tensorflow - not working !


Downgrading to py3.6

on win 10 python 3.7 I ran

conda install tensorflow-gpu  --dry-run 


after about 5minutes it provided a remedy which included downgrading to py 3.6.7


This suggest to me you can create an enviorment within or in addition to your base install loading it with python 36 .. Check the docs its not that complicated .  I did this with pyhon 2.7 a long time ago.

After re-vist If you have a mac system, the following command will help you install tensorflow on your machine.
P.S. It does work with Python 3.7

python3 -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl

Sure, but i am assuming that:
1. You've installed Anaconda and conda command on cmd works fine.
2. Your system is a Windows one

So: 
- Create a new environment:  _conda create -n tensorflow_ or _conda create --name tensorflow_
- Go into your new environment: _source activate tensorflow_ or _conda activate tensorflow_
- Install tensorflow keras: _conda install tensorflow keras_

Regards. > Python 3.7 appears to be official now, ("final release" on June 27th).

No, It may be official, but it still isn't "installable", unless of course, the name has changed. the error I got was  -

@MaximusIndus That was about Python 3.7, not Tensorflow.  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#release-scheduleTrue, 
I think Python is expendable none use whatsoever as it just survives on Open source - Undependable Open Source at that. Better to move to motivated, money driven Sucker.> I got the same issue with Python 3.7, I just use conda to reinstall tensorflow and keras dependencies.

Great it works on centosPython 3.7 didn't support TensoFlow.
I can use TensorFlow by using Python 3.6.
If you want to use TensorFlow, install python3.6 and use it.diagressing a bit from OP...
BERT (NLP) needs Tensorflow 1.10.0 or higher and the same is available only if I have Python 3.6.5 on Windows PC (x64) I got the same issue with Python 3.7, I tried running  reinstall tensorflow and keras dependencies. this didnt work , error log below  ,need help to resolve this please

create an environment and use python 36. install spyder and pandas with conda. Install tensorflow-gpu with pip.  I suggested this before on an earlier post. Tensorflow recommends pip not conda.

thats tf-1.3 while tf-1.12 is outIt's stupid to me that python 3.7 is still not support yet..Why is this issue closed? Tensorflow doesn't support Python 3.7 yet.. Or is there a different issue that tracks Python 3.7 support?  
May I humbly suggest that someone with permissions lock this issue, to limit comments to collaborators? That'd prevent spam for those of us watching this issue to get notified about when 3.7 support lands. Thanks.below works for Windows 8.1, python 3.7.1 (installed via Miniconda)

now is support python3.7.x+win10+tensorflow?From https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/#files or https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/tensorflow/ , I see no python3.7 support now.I have built the .whl for tensorflow 1.12.0 with python 3.7.2
pip3 install tensorflow-1.12.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
ensure pip3 is pointing to 3.7.2
file is here https://bit.ly/2FBoFs2
right now only cpu build is availableSo Python 3.7 is still not supported even if it is 2019 now.quite amazing that Google didnt make any move for this long time... I was stuck on installing.

All websites for tensorflow don't work with regular tensorflow install instructions.
Using tf-nightly does let me install without a problem on Python 3.7.2 (x64).> I was stuck on installing.

I switched back to Python 3.6. Do not use the latest Anaconda since it comes with Python 3.7.After everything I tried, I finally decided to switch back on Python 3.6.8  : : Anaconda.
And now tensorflow is working for me!
Here is the command for it!

**conda install tensorflow keras**As of now, tensorflow does not work with Python 3.7. 

If you are using Anaconda, do the following: 
`conda install python=3.6`
Then
`conda install tensorflow keras`

Done and save yourself the headaches. #25429 On Windows, this distribution works for me:
https://github.com/fo40225/tensorflow-windows-wheel`!pip install tf-nightly`

This works for me :D> As of now, tensorflow does not work with Python 3.7.

TF v1.13.0-rc1 cpu version now works for me on python 3.7.2 (high sierra). Installs and imports just fine.

edit: According to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517#issuecomment-461910761, both cpu and gpu versions should be available on all OSes.TensorFlow v1.13.0rc1 is now working for me on python 3.7.0 on windows 10. i had to upgrade my numpy package to v1.16.1 to overcome some few errors.Yes, to reiterate: The 1.13.0rc1 release includes Python3.7 binaries for all OS-es for [cpu](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/1.13.0rc1/#files) and [gpu](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/1.13.0rc1/#files). >

And for CUDA 10, there is only CuDNN 7 (namely, 7.3.0, 7.3.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2) as far as I can see.Hello,
I can confirm now TensorFlow Nightly Build GPU works with

Hi please can you let me know how I can change interpreter and install with 3.6 pls?[Tensorflow 1.13.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.13.1) now supports Python 3.7.> pip install tensorflow==1.13.1

You should try the nigthly build.
Great that TensorFlow 1 finally supports Python 3.7! This page should probably be updated to reflect that: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip (currently, it says that for Python 3, only 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are suported)

Does this mean that Python 3.7 is also supported by the preview release of [TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha)?@lamberta who can update that in the appropriate places.

[Yes](https://pypi.org/manage/project/tensorflow/release/2.0.0a0/) it is.Currently Python 3.7 "pip install tensorflow" still doesn't work

Works for me, both tensorflow 2.0 and 1.13 could be found@PathToLife this seems like a configuration issue. Can you please open a new GitHub issue with additional information. I can confirm the binaries for all three OS's for Python3.7 are there.Can confirm the URLs here for the 3.7 package: 
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#package-locationThere still seems to be no [complete URL](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#package-location) for Python 3.7 and Windows, which is what the installation instructions tells you to use when using Conda. I.e. accordingly, Python 3.7 is still off limits for Conda on Windows.Actually, I don't know whether this intuition is correct or not. I was using pip install keras in a virtual environment of Python 2.7 but it was of no use and when I did import keras, it didn't work. Later I did pip install Keras. A capital 'K' and then it worked. Maybe, try it.**tensorflow-gpu** works well on **Python 3.7.2**

tensorflow-gpu works well on Python 3.7.3
OS : Windows 10 x64
Python : 3.7.3
CUDA : 10.0
CUDNN : 7.6.1.34It has been a year. Is TensorFlow ever going to update to the supported version of Python or are we forever stuck in 2018?Hey @StevenGann can you please clarify? Which version would you like supported on which OS? I believe TF supports Python3.7 on both CPU and GPU on all our supported OS-es which is why this issue was opened.pip install tensorflow==1.13.1
it works for me on Python 3.7
Good Luck.>

Thanks that worked! I wonder why I didn't have installed the x64 versionOS : Windows 10 Pro
Python 3.7.6
Still not able to install Tensorflow in 2020.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10788426/73738438-78fa5a80-476a-11ea-8e04-9c272707163c.png)

Your log says `No matching distribution found for tensroflow`

`tensroflow`Ahh got it..stupid typo !For those still experiencing issues with installing Tensorflow with Python 3.7, here is a proposed solution, especially if you are using Intel CPUs to run your workloads. In an activated conda environment with Python 3.7.x:

```
python -v
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 19:59:22)
[GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
```

Execute: 
`conda install tensorflow=1.15 `

In the list of packages to be installed, you should see:
`tensorflow         pkgs/main/linux-64::tensorflow-1.15.0-mkl_py37h28c19af_0`


This should install Tensorflow version 1.15 with the latest Intel MKL-DNN optimizations for best performance on Intel CPUs. 

As mentioned in the [pip install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#2.-create-a-virtual-environment-recommended), Conda is *not* officially supported and is provided by the Conda community. And the [last update](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow) looks like it was 4 months ago> As mentioned in the [pip install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#2.-create-a-virtual-environment-recommended), Conda is _not_ officially supported and is provided by the Conda community. And the [last update](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow) looks like it was 4 months ago

Good point and good catch. Then, let's rephrase it differently: If the official pip method does not work for you, the community-supported method could help. Traceback (most recent call last):

Please see: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36167#issuecomment-577886156**Hello guys!! I have a problem with installing _Tensorflow_!**
**Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32**

**How to install it ???**TF does not work on 32 bits.Is there an alternative to Tensorflow for 32-bit users?You can use Google Colab notebooks, just like other Google Drive files and have your code run in the cloud.

GCP also offers VMs suited for deep learning that could be used in the cloud> Trying to install the Tensorflow API through pip in a virtual environment results in this:
> 
> `Collecting tensorflow Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for tensorflow`
> 
> Has tensorflow not officially been released yet?

it's released but,not supported yet,.... Downgrade it
