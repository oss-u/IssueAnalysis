After the conda installation, the Jupyter notebook does not start. There is a command window, which shows up for 1-2 seconds but disappears. The Spyder does work properly so far. 

More background information here: Windows 7, used to have an older version Anaconda, tried to update but found nothing worked after update. Uninstalled, and reinstalled the latest version Anaconda 4.3.0 with python2.7 64bit. Neither Spyder or Jupyter launches afterwards. Did "conda update --all". Found Spyder works but not Jupyter Notebook.Can you get an Anaconda command prompt and run `jupyter notebook` in it? It probably won't work, but you should get an error message saying what's failing.takluyver,
Thanks a lot! I just tried, and found it actually works by running from the command window! The problem looks like that the "Jupyter notebook" shortcut in the Windows start menu is messed up?I wonder if that's left over from the older version of Anaconda. The shortcut properties might tell you what it's trying to call - there may be a wrong path to Anaconda or something.Closing as I don't think there's anything wrong in our code; feel free to keep using comments to work out what's going on.Did you fix this problem? I got this problem as well. Jupyter is launching from the cmd but not from the Windows shortcut. Can you look at the properties of the Windows shortcut to see what it's launching? The shortcut is something that Anaconda makes, so we don't directly control it.i looked at the properties.. this is what it's launching:
C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\python.exe
C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\cwp.py 
C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3 
"C:/Users/Name/Anaconda3/python.exe" 
"C:/Users/Name/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter-notebook-script.py"
%HOME%Yes, the problem was resolved. The shortcut was the issue. I had to
manually change the "Shortcut target" (in windows 7) to the following:
C:\Users\'yourusername'\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda2\Scripts\jupyter-notebook.exe
Let me know if works.
Thanks,

jap, using jupyter-notebook.exe as shortcut target did the trick!

thank you very much! :-)Thanks @hlignin . If anyone wants to follow up the shortcut issue, the [anaconda-issues](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/) repo is probably the place to report it.This is my environment.
> Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
> Anaconda3 4.3.0

I've experienced the same problem.

This is the default target of "Jupyter Notebook" shortcut. (in my case)
> C:\Users\hwync\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\Users\hwync\Anaconda3\cwp.py C:\Users\hwync\Anaconda3 "C:/Users/hwync/Anaconda3/python.exe" "C:/Users/hwync/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter-notebook-script.py" %HOME%

In here, `%HOME%` caused the problem.

So, I solved the problem with following solutions.
Please choose your preferred method.

## 1. Add a new `HOME` in system variables.
Go to `Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables`, add a new `HOME` in system variables.
> Variable name : HOME
> Variable value : C:\Users\hwync\Documents\Notebooks


## 2. Change `%HOME%` to path.
`%HOME%` ⇒ `C:\Users\hwync\Documents\Notebooks`


## 3. Change `%HOME%` to `%JUPYTER_HOME%` and add in system variables.
`%HOME%` ⇒ `%JUPYTER_HOME%`
Go to `Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables`, add a new `JUPYTER_HOME` in system variables.
> Variable name : JUPYTER_HOME
> Variable value : C:\Users\hwync\Documents\NotebooksThanks for the detailed write up! Someone should probably report this to
Anaconda, because they make the start menu shortcut.

@hwyncho great work! Thanks!Hi, 
I looked at my set up and the icons have the following properties: :
"C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\envs\env_name\python.exe"
"C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\cwp.py"
"C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\envs\env_name"
"C:/Users/Name/Anaconda3/envs/env_name/python.exe"
"C:/Users/Name/Anaconda3/envs/env_name/Scrip            

- this part is missing from the target text due to limit on the taget text box in icon properties pop up:       ts/jupyter-notebook-script.py"

Two questions:  
1. I think the missing part of the file path is causing a problem. Would you agree?
2.  The second entry is not point to the envs version of  cwp.py, which could also be causing a problem.  Would you agree? 

If the first is correct, I believe the only way to correct is for me to change my User folder name which seems quite problematic for Win 10.  Any suggestions? 

Many Thanks, 

Alan

1. I don't know if that's a problem affecting the actual value, or just its display in the properties dialog. If it is affecting the actual value, it could very well be the problem.
2. I'm not entirely sure what `cwp.py` does, but I suspect it doesn't matter that it's not pointing to the one in the env. You're better off asking Anaconda people about it.Hi, I have the same issue here as well, Jupyter opens from the command line but not from the shortcut. How do I inspect the shortcut to see where it is linking to? I can't find the shortcut in the Anaconda3 folder.Just solved this for the windows shortcut on Windows 8.1. My windows user has a space in the name, so in the shortcut I had to wrap the %USERPROFILE%  path with double quotes as "%USERPROFILE%"

Still have been unable to get the shortcut within anaconda navigator working.@JoomSavvy Thanks! Put USERPROFILE in double quotes ..now the shortcut is working!@JoomSavvy  Thanks, it worked for me!It appears your doc and code are not longer in sync e.g. running jupyter notebook fails. Running jupyter-notebook works however.I tried to open jupyter from anaconda command prompt and also from navigator but for both it doesn't open up. Instead of Internet explorer microsoft edge comes up but doesn't open jupyter and gets close automatically. what could be the issue ? 
P.S. : i am able to open spider.@Eyshika - if you enter `jupyter notebook` in a command prompt what is the exact, full output you see in the terminal? Just copy/paste the un-abridged/edited output into a new comment.

Even if a browser doesn't open up you should be able to manually open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`.

Also, I'd recommend to never use Internet Explorer, basically for anything but in particular I don't think the notebook works with it. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25290579/30815290-bf13dc44-a1e0-11e7-895e-75ec5518460c.png)

Also, if I should not open it on Internet explorer then which browser is recommended?Chrome and Firefox are well supported. Edge should be fine, so I'm a bit surprised. If you grab that full url that has the token and put it in Edge, does it do the same weird behavior?It works now, with url. i don't know why it was showing error.
But now it's not giving me any output on python3 jupyterAny errors in the output on the terminal you started it from?Hi I have the same problem on windows 10. Both  Jupyter and Spider  cannot be launched. I tried all your solutions mentioned above , but still it is not working.My problem was my user's folder had a space in folder name.

After creating a new user and switching to that windows user, windows shortcuts and links from within' Anaconda worked fine.

Windows 8.1 64 Bit. Latest Anaconda.

Note: I ended up uninstalling an reinstalling Anaconda but my sense is the problem was really just the space in the windows user username/user folder.@rgbkrk you were right, It works perfectly now@tatullia When you type jupyter notebook in your prompt it must be giving you some url, use that url to open jupyterTrying to update, re-installed completely and now I get this error.@megamindbrian What is the error you are getting ?I tried installing with pip and got (py36)
C:\Users\brian.cullinan\Documents\jupytangular2>jupyter lab
Cannot open
C:\Users\brian.cullinan\AppData\Local\Continuum\Miniconda3\envs\py36\Scripts\jupyter-script.py

Installed with conda instructions and it works now.  Thank you!  Might need
to look into the installer code because I don't think pip install works on
Windows.

@tareknahool That looks like a path problem.  In "Advanced system settings" -> Environment Variables, what does the PATH= read as?
Did you follow conda instructions?

 Dear megamindbrian ,thax for your prompt response.
But, actually I don’t know how to solve this problem.Try these instructions, and post your PATH variable and what instructions
you followed to start installing jupyter in the first place:

The Anaconda prompt is supposed to set up PATH for you, but it looks like it's going wrong. You might try asking on anaconda-issues: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/Same issue here with the latest Anaconda3 build (5.0.1) for Win10 64-bit. After installing the full anaconda distribution, neither Python nor Jupyter can be launched from the command prompt. I get "xyz is not a recognized command....." error on the Anaconda prompt. I'm planning to manually add the Anaconda home directory/scripts paths to the PATH environment variable and report back what I encounter thereafter. If `python` doesn't work either, that's definitely an Anaconda problem, so I'd suggest opening an issue on anaconda-issues.I installed anaconda3.6 for windows 10 64 bit via UI and then did "conda install py27" . I am able to start spyder etc and change engine from 3.6 to 2.7. I have added anaconda in the path for my user. Jupyter notebok no longer loading and it shows below error.

@dhirschfeld Hi, do you know what can I do if localhost:8000  cannot also open in the browser? I've tried Chrome, IE, Edge...And installed Anaconda twice...In IE you need to go to the Internet Options and under the proxy info there add a bypass for `localhost,127.0.0.1`@dhirschfeld Thanks so much! It works well now!I had installed Anaconda in C:\     root directory and Jupyter was not launching.Fortunately my IT Sys admin helped me to trace it in C:\Anaconda3\Scripts and I changed my shortcut path and Jupyter launched.Hi,

I am not able to create new or view any of my .ipynb files in the browser when launched either through cmd prompt or Anaconda Navigator. I could easily launch and view files till yesterday but I don't know what happened that I can't anymore.

@megha89 did you resolve your problem?  I have the exact same issue where I can launch jupyter notebook but I can't open or edit any of my notebooks.  Everything was working fine until I tried to install the ggplot library via the conda prompt and now I get an internal server 500 error.I think Anti-virus is blocking your application. When you installed
Anaconda a screen pops up stating do you want to allow the application to
access outside. You might have cancelled that screen which is why you may
be facing the problem. Disable antivirus and launch jupyter. If it doesnt
work again. Please uninstall the software and reinstall once again, this
time carefully see each screen.

Thanks @transtrades , I tried that but didn't seem to resolve the problem.  I'll have to uninstall and reinstall.  Any chance you know of an easy way to archive all my files before I uninstall?Did you try from start menu? Go to Windows Start-->Anaconda3-->Jupyter and
open.It may open Jupyter after a minute.

If you want to reinstall, Your files will not be lost if you have saved
them in some folder with a name and not as Untitled1, Untitled2...Untitled
files get lost.

Better transfer all the code files to a backup drive such as D or E ....or
pen drive.

Dont keep any files in C:\ drive and its sub folders.

When you uninstall there will still be traces of the software in folders
under your Users. There will be minor folders such as .anaconda , .conda,
.spyder....... just delete them using Shift + del.

Restart the system and then reinstall anaconda. It is advisable to install
in root directories such as C:\Anaconda3 or D:\Anaconda3 or E:\Anaconda3
while installing.

Reason you will need to add libraries later using cmd (command prompt) It
will be easy to go to C:\Anaconda3 or D:\Anaconda3 or E:\Anaconda3 and
install the libraries.

While installing you will get a java pop up asking that a program is trying
to access outside, do you want to allow? you check the options and say Yes

After Jupyter is installed, go to Start-->Anaconda3-->Jupyter Notebook. It
will take a minute opens and gives out a weblink on cmd prompt.copy the
same and paste it on chrome / netscape/internet explorer and Jupyter will
open on the browser.

I tried launching from the start menu, from the anaconda navigator, and from the conda prompt.  Each time I am able to launch the Jupyter NOtebook tree but when I try to open a python notebook I get the 500: Internal Server error.  And this is what I see in the prompt:

If your jupyter doen't open, dont bother. You can use google collab which
gives free jupyter interface for programming. you will be working on google
hosted server. you can work from laptop or mobile and you just need to have
internet connection and gmail account. You can work at a stretch for 8
hours. visit http://colab.research.google.com and open your account. Then
go and open new jupyter notebook and do coding.

I had same problem. Conda didn't launch jupyter notebook. I found a hard way and I can open now. My solution is: 
1- Open Anaconda Navigator
2- C:\Users\Your Pc Name\.anaconda\navigator\scripts in this folder Run notebook.bat
3- In same folder open notebook-err-1.txt and you will see like this: file:///C:/Users/o%C4%9Fuzhan%20pc/AppData/Roaming/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-10688-open.html
copy and paste this your browser and done. I hope it will be helpfullTraceback (most recent call last):

I am getting this errorhi i ve been trying to launch jupyter and spyder both don't work. I tried to open through command prompt there is no response for indefinite time. tried to install notebook from pip too. 
using a win 10 64 bit os.
Is this the first time? You have cancelled a small screen which would have
said. Python is trying to contact external site. That's why you are not
able to open. Restart, try to open spider or Jupiter. If you get that
message, enable it. Then spyder/Jupiter will open. If you dont get the
screen. Uninstall and reinstall anaconda. This time if a small screen pops
up python is trying to contact external site, enable it

First time working with jupyter? no.
no, did not get any sort of popup screen ,have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling a couple of times what changed this time was spyder launched till completion of code for python but i still couldnt access the environment. when i try to close anaconda navigator it prompts that notebook and spyder are running. i tried manually accessing localhost:port with all the browsers. thanks for the response though.

What's your RAM & CPU configuration,? Usually spyder takes 3 minutes to
start. Jupiter also takes a minute or two.

For spyder wait for 3-4 min. Incase of jupyterwhen you click on Jupiter in
START menu a popup command prompt opens. Move your mouse cursor inside that
command window and press enter. It will show some messages and opens in
your browser

Your firewall and antivirus would be blocking python. If you allow python
to be connected to internet by providing exception in antivirus or firewall
you will not face problem.

Instead of installing python in your computer,  try using cloud version of
python in google colab. It is free but you need internet

> If your jupyter doen't open, dont bother. You can use google collab which gives free jupyter interface for programming. you will be working on google hosted server. you can work from laptop or mobile and you just need to have internet connection and gmail account. You can work at a stretch for 8 hours. visit http://colab.research.google.com and open your account. Then go and open new jupyter notebook and do coding. Rgds Prasad

Hi did you manage to solve this error? What did you do?Looks like jupyter is not installed properly.

If you have installed Anaconda, try opening jupyter from Anaconda Navigator.

Another attempt type localhost:8080 or localhost:8888 in your browser

If both dont work, uninstall anaconda3 completely, reinstall anaconda at c:\

Use google colab which has jupyter on cloud at research.google.com

I have problem but when I open jupter-notebook.exe its work but I have other problem how I can connect with anacondaUninstall all

Install anaconda in c:\ directory only. Use custom installation

After installation is complete when you launch jupyter your application may
be blocked by firewall or antivirus. Pls enable it to connect to internet
