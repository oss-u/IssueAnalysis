Hi everyone

I've just downloaded and installed "Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64" to my PC running windows 10. When I start Anaconda prompt and type;

(base) C:\Users\...>jupyter notebook
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users...\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\notebook\services\sessions\sessionmanager.py", line 10, in <module>
    import sqlite3
  File "C:\Users\...\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\sqlite3\__init__.py", line 23, in <module>
    from sqlite3.dbapi2 import *
  File "C:\Users\...\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\sqlite3\dbapi2.py", line 27, in <module>
    from _sqlite3 import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\...\Continuum\anaconda3\Scripts\jupyter-notebook-script.py", line 6, in <module>
    from notebook.notebookapp import main
  File "C:\Users\...\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\notebook\notebookapp.py", line 86, in <module>
    from .services.sessions.sessionmanager import SessionManager
  File "C:\Users\...\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\notebook\services\sessions\sessionmanager.py", line 13, in <module>
    from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite3
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysqlite2'

I've already check sqlite is list on Anaconda's installed packages, and also search web but notting found.

I think Its not about jupyter notebook itself, because when I try to import sqllite;

(base) C:\Users\...>python
Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 10 2018, 22:54:23) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32

>>> from _sqlite3 import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.
>>>

getting same error

thanks
İbrahimMe too having same errorIf this is still a problem, you probably want to ask the Anaconda team about it: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/I've just installed previous version, it's working now...

I'm having this exact problem too.UPDATE w/ FIX: I fixed this problem by adding `*anaconda root*/Library/bin` to my PATH.

I am also having this issue with version 2018.12

@kyledmiller Thanks a ton. There are lots of seemingly convoluted threads going on about this issue and your fix corrected the issue for me.Fixed it! Even though it doesn't really make sense (or perhaps I have the wrong understanding of how jupyter notebook works), this is what I did:

I just activated my environment before starting the notebook. So I did "activate [env]" first, before typing in "jupyter notebook" from my Anaconda command prompt@johntiger1 I wasn't using an environment when this error occurred as I had everything installed to root. If you only had python/jupyter installed to an environment, then it would make sense that you could only use it within that environment but otherwise I'm a bit confused by your comment. > Fixed it!

My issue got resolved by this. Thank you very much :)After a successful installation of Anaconda 2019.03 (for Windows Installer) on Windows 10 64 bit(Python 3.7 already installed at different path), I passed the command to invoke "Jupyter notebook" and got this error "loading dll". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it on the default path too, but still met the same fate. I have tried out the various workarounds provided but could not resolve this issue, please help me resolve this.

how did you add `*anaconda root*/Library/bin`  in your path ?https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml> There is an issue with the 64 Bit version of Anaconda. Try these steps:

@GiorgioBalestrieri It's with 64Bit Windows version of Anaconda, and this is just a common issue with a lot of Windows users including me and few of my colleagues. Please feel free to share your views if for you it is working. :)

@Deborshi1993 I think I wasn't clear, I was not questioning whether it's an issue with Anaconda, I was trying to get visibility on the issue/thread where this is being tracked. 
I faced the exact the same problem (also on Windows, also Anaconda 64bit, but for some reason only for some environments, specifically some using Python 3.7) . 
I was asking for a source because if there is a known issue it should be tracked somewhere, and I'm quite sure Continuum would have someone actively working on it. It would be useful for people reading this thread being able to check the status of that issue and for people working on that issue to know it's cascading into things like this one.> > > > > > There is an issue with the 64 Bit version of Anaconda.

@GiorgioBalestrieri Yes, you are right. But also for me, I had to go through the threads to find an exact approach to solve this issue. Hence, I wrote the exact process I followed to bring up Jupyter Notebook and this worked with some. I am sorry to say, there is no other source I can refer you at this moment. :) I fixed this issue by replace file  C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)i sovled this issue by copy file C:\Anaconda3\Libary\bin\sqlite3.dll to C:\Anaconda3\Dllsfor me, since i used anaconda64 i activate the env and installed,
`conda install -c anaconda pywin32 `
and it solved> for me, since i used anaconda64 i activate the env and installed,

Thanks. It worked for me, even in a R environment.> I fixed this issue by replace file C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)

It works for me! thanks!I was trying to open the notebook in a separate virtual environment where anaconda is not set up. Make sure that you open the notebook in the same _base_ environment.> for me, since i used anaconda64 i activate the env and installed,

didn't work for me!the solution is to write in CMD:
`activate root`
then 
`jupyter notebook`> UPDATE w/ FIX: I fixed this problem by adding `*anaconda root*/Library/bin` to my PATH.

I tried it and it works for me
`conda activate base`
`jupyter notebook`neither of these solutions worked for me. please suggest.> I fixed this issue by replace file C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)

This worked for me as well. I copied the sqlite3.dll into the system32 folder.  I was getting error messages trying to install the google cloud SDK.  This fixed it. https://stackoverflow.com/a/53779060/12958312

This one worked for me.> > I fixed this issue by replace file C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)

It worked, Thanks.> Fixed it! Even though it doesn't really make sense (or perhaps I have the wrong understanding of how jupyter notebook works), this is what I did:

Worked for me!

Have a good one> the solution is to write in CMD:

Best solution so far. The problem is that the root environment was not properly loaded. Worked for me like a charm.> I fixed this issue by replace file C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)

Than kyou very much Bruh!!> I fixed this issue by replace file C:\Windows\System32\sqlite3.dll by C:\Users\Rvor\Anaconda3\Library\bin\sqlite3.dll :)

Awesome, this fixed my issue. thanks for posting it. saved time
I tried all above solutions but didn't work for me until I install latest version of Microsft Visual C++It seems that Anaconda python 3.7.x has the problem, we can fix it as

or download the file 'sqlite3.dll' from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html,  and put it in '\Anaconda3\DLLs\sqlite3.dll'.
@Deborshi1993 thank you Simpler Solution would be just to activate base
Open CMD
and type "activate base"> Fixed it! Even though it doesn't really make sense (or perhaps I have the wrong understanding of how jupyter notebook works), this is what I did:
