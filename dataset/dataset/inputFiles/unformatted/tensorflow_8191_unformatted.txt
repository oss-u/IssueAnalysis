I am not sure if I am the first who met the following error:

ValueError: Attempt to reuse RNNCell <tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops.core_rnn_cell_impl.BasicLSTMCell object at 0x10210d5c0> with a different variable scope than its first use.  First use of cell was with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/basic_lstm_cell', this attempt is with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_1/basic_lstm_cell'.  Please create a new instance of the cell if you would like it to use a different set of weights.  If before you were using: MultiRNNCell([BasicLSTMCell(...)] * num_layers), change to: MultiRNNCell([BasicLSTMCell(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]).  If before you were using the same cell instance as both the forward and reverse cell of a bidirectional RNN, simply create two instances (one for forward, one for reverse).  In May 2017, we will start transitioning this cell's behavior to use existing stored weights, if any, when it is called with scope=None (which can lead to silent model degradation, so this error will remain until then.)

with the code fragment:

      import tensorflow as tf
      from tensorflow.contrib import rnn

      hidden_size = 100
      batch_size  = 100
      num_steps   = 100
      num_layers  = 100
      is_training = True
      keep_prob   = 0.4

      input_data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [batch_size, num_steps])
      lstm_cell = rnn.BasicLSTMCell(hidden_size, forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True)

      if is_training and keep_prob < 1:
          lstm_cell = rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm_cell)
      cell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell for _ in range(num_layers)], state_is_tuple=True)

      _initial_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)

      iw = tf.get_variable("input_w", [1, hidden_size])
      ib = tf.get_variable("input_b", [hidden_size])
      inputs = [tf.nn.xw_plus_b(i_, iw, ib) for i_ in tf.split(input_data, num_steps, 1)]

      if is_training and keep_prob < 1:
          inputs = [tf.nn.dropout(input_, keep_prob) for input_ in inputs]
    
      outputs, states = rnn.static_rnn(cell, inputs, initial_state=_initial_state)

I had googled around with no luck, can anyone show me a way out?I am getting the same error when trying to run the translate example (even when doing the small self test) which can be found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/translateI met the same issue. If you are all using compiled version on master branch, I believe that we are the same issue caused by the [recent commit](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/54d50ffec8df4f748694632dbe5ebde9971e2c9e). As the commit message says:

> Make all RNNCells in tf.contrib.rnn act like tf.layers Layers, but with stricter semantics for no
w:
>
>    1. Upon first use of __call__, the used scope is stored in the cell. The RNNCell tries to create weights in that scope but if some are already set, an error is raised unless the RNNCell was constructed with argument reuse=True.
>
>    2. A subsequent use of __call__ of the same cell instance must be in the same scope.
>       If it is not, an error is raised.

From my case, which is running the [ptb tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb), the solution is just to add a parameter named with `reuse` like this at line 112:

    def lstm_cell():
      return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(
          size, forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True, reuse=tf.get_variable_scope().reuse)

Then it works.@ebrevdo Could you please take a look at this?The issue replicates for me when using the Windows/GPU build 105 on the [Shakespeare RNN Repo](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare).

When running the code with the Win 1.0.0/GPU Release, there is no issue.That repo looks like it's targeted at tf 1.0, not intermediate releases.

@tongda , I am using the Release Version of Tensorflow 1.0, working on MacOS in cpu mode. I will switch to the master branch to see if it work by adding the "reuse" parameter, thanks.doncat99: if you do, please ensure your code queries the tensorflow version
and raises a flag if the version is lower than the master branch version.
 you may need to check against:

from tensorflow.core import versions
versions.GIT_VERSION

@ebrevdo So what would be the suggested changes to the Shakepeare RNN to allow it to work with the intermediate stable release?

Here is the key architectural section of the code, which now fails with build#105:
```python
#
# the model (see FAQ in README.md)
#
lr = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='lr')  # learning rate
pkeep = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='pkeep')  # dropout parameter
batchsize = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, name='batchsize')

# inputs
X = tf.placeholder(tf.uint8, [None, None], name='X')    # [ BATCHSIZE, SEQLEN ]
Xo = tf.one_hot(X, ALPHASIZE, 1.0, 0.0)                 # [ BATCHSIZE, SEQLEN, ALPHASIZE ]
# expected outputs = same sequence shifted by 1 since we are trying to predict the next character
Y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.uint8, [None, None], name='Y_')  # [ BATCHSIZE, SEQLEN ]
Yo_ = tf.one_hot(Y_, ALPHASIZE, 1.0, 0.0)               # [ BATCHSIZE, SEQLEN, ALPHASIZE ]
# input state
Hin = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, INTERNALSIZE*NLAYERS], name='Hin')  # [ BATCHSIZE, INTERNALSIZE * NLAYERS]

# using a NLAYERS=3 layers of GRU cells, unrolled SEQLEN=30 times
# dynamic_rnn infers SEQLEN from the size of the inputs Xo

onecell = rnn.GRUCell(INTERNALSIZE)
dropcell = rnn.DropoutWrapper(onecell, input_keep_prob=pkeep)
multicell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([dropcell for _ in range(NLAYERS)], state_is_tuple=False)
multicell = rnn.DropoutWrapper(multicell, output_keep_prob=pkeep)
Yr, H = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(multicell, Xo, dtype=tf.float32, initial_state=Hin)
# Yr: [ BATCHSIZE, SEQLEN, INTERNALSIZE ]
# H:  [ BATCHSIZE, INTERNALSIZE*NLAYERS ] # this is the last state in the sequence
```
I do not seem to find any documentation regarding a `reuse` flag?

Thanks in advance.Use:

multicell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([rnn.DropoutWrapper(rnn.GRUCell(INTERNALSIZE),
input_keep_prob=pkeep) for _ in range(NLAYERS)], state_is_tuple=False)


Which creates a separate grucell object for each layer.

I don't understand why I am getting this error with the [seq2seq tutorial model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/seq2seq_model.py):
```python
cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([single_cell() for _ in range(num_layers)])
```
[Source](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/seq2seq_model.py#L129)

where the cell is created with
```python
def single_cell():
    return tf.contrib.rnn.GRUCell(size)
```

@ebrevdo Thanks for getting back to this issue. Unfortunately, the suggested change leaves matters as they are, with the aforementioned error. Given the above comment regarding the **seq2seq tutorial**, I suspect we are all in the same boat?Are you sure it's the exact same error?  Please copy and paste it here.My bad, I just went through the change process to the relevant code again (from scratch) and re-ran it as proposed. The error has indeed been removed and the Old Bard is hallucinating just fine now 👍 

So, thx, not sure where I went wrong yesterday, but it was clearly on me.I met the same problem when using the Release Version of Tensorflow 1.0 and working on MacOS in cpu mode.Even if add the "reuse" parameter
```
def cell():
    return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(rnn_size,state_is_tuple=True,reuse=tf.get_variable_scope().reuse)

muticell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([cell for _ in range(num_layers)], state_is_tuple=True)
```your multicell looks wrong... you should be using "cell() for _ in
range(...)"

I was trying to run the translate example: python2.7 translate.py --data_dir data/ --train_dir train/ --size=256 --num_layers=2 --steps_per_checkpoint=50

It seems the way to use MultiRNNCell is correct:
cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([single_cell() for _ in range(num_layers)])

But I got the same error:
ValueError: Attempt to reuse RNNCell <tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops.core_rnn_cell_impl.GRUCell object at 0x7fba0683de90> with a different variable scope than its first use.  First use of cell was with scope 'embedding_attention_seq2seq/embedding_attention_decoder/attention_decoder/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell', this attempt is with scope 'embedding_attention_seq2seq/rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell'.  Please create a new instance of the cell if you would like it to use a different set of weights.  If before you were using: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...)] * num_layers), change to: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]).  If before you were using the same cell instance as both the forward and reverse cell of a bidirectional RNN, simply create two instances (one for forward, one for reverse).  In May 2017, we will start transitioning this cell's behavior to use existing stored weights, if any, when it is called with scope=None (which can lead to silent model degradation, so this error will remain until then.)@bowu - did you have any luck with this? if you haven't tried it yet, reinstall tensorflow from the latest source. there were some changes to some of the core_rnn files, among a few others. works for me now.@robmsylvester I reinstall tensorflow from the latest source, still the same error. I was on branch master and the latest commit is `commit 2a4811054a9e6b83e1f5a2705a92aab50e151b13`. What's the latest commit when you build your repo?Hi, I am using Tensorflow r1.0 using GPU built using source. I am trying to follow the unmodified Seq2Seq translation tutorial, but I'm getting the same error. i.e.

> ValueError: Attempt to reuse RNNCell <tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops.core_rnn_cell_impl.GRUCell object at 0x7f0fb51ebb00> with a different variable scope than its first use.  First use of cell was with scope 'embedding_attention_seq2seq/embedding_attention_decoder/attention_decoder/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell', this attempt is with scope 'embedding_attention_seq2seq/rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell'.....

The relevant portion of the code in my seq2seq_model.py is:
```
 # Create the internal multi-layer cell for our RNN.
    def single_cell():
      return tf.contrib.rnn.GRUCell(size)
    if use_lstm:
      def single_cell():
        return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(size)
    cell = single_cell()
    if num_layers > 1:
      cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([single_cell() for _ in range(num_layers)])
```

What can I do to solve the problem?

adding "reuse=tf.get_variable_scope().reuse" to the call where the GRUCell is created doesn't help.

Thanks a ton!@prashantserai - see what happens if you remove the MultiRNNCell line from above, effectively making your network just one layer. Does it work then? It might be a bug somewhere in MultiRNNCell. I've read about that somewhere recently, probably on stack overflow.

If you implement the stacked lstm/gru yourself, you don't get this error, and you can implement the same functionality (actually more, because you're free to do whatever you want with bidirectional architectures, weird residual and skip connections, etc.)@robmsylvester The same error persisted even when I tried with num_layers=1 which should effectively skip that line. Any other ideas? Thanks for the input.Hmmm. One thing that stands out to me is in the referenced legacy seq2seq file:

`encoder_cell = copy.deepcopy(cell)`

This line appears to be used because the same architecture is used on both the encoder and decoder side. They make a copy of the cell, then pass the cell argument along to the attention decoder embedding function, then to the attention decoder itself. 

What happens if you explicitly create the encoder cell AND the decoder cell in your seq2seq model file and pass both along to the legacy library file, making the small adjustments to the functions and their arguments?
@robmsylvester  shouldn't making changes in the scopes of the cells work? It's working for the other two examples as well. In my opinion, this would be a very ugly workaround; a cleaner solution must exist; maybe we are missing something? ( I got the same error on the seq2seq tutorial as well, tried all of the above solutions).@iamgroot42 - Yeah, that 'solution' is admittedly very ugly, but more so just trying to hunt down where an issue might be. I'll play with it in a few hours and see if I can track something down.In fact, the copy.deepcopy is there because these are legacy functions and
we don't have the resources to maintain/update them.  If you'd like to
introduce a backwards-compatible change that allows the user to provide a
second cell for the decoding step, and if it's None then to fallback on the
deepcopy, then I would be happy to review the PR.  Keep in mind it would
have to be a backwards compatible change.

@ebrevdo - I'll think about it. I do have a translator that works pretty similar to this one but creates cells through a separate class that allows for inserting bidirectional layers where you want, residuals where you want, merging inputs with concat vs. sum, and a few other things. I think I could migrate my class over to this tutorial pretty easily by using static RNN's. I'll let you know.@ebrevdo i am running Tensorflow r1.0 (tensorflow-1.0.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64) on Red Hat and have the latest version of the translation tutorial from Github.. is there a way you know to make this work currently?It's unfortunate that the translation tutorial does not work with TF 1.0.  We should fix that.  @lukaszkaiser can you take a look?  We're working on a new tutorial but it's still a few weeks off and will require a nightly version of TensorFlow (or TF 1.1 or 1.2) to work.(lukasz; it's hard for me to identify from the various comments which part of the tutorial is faulty in TF 1.0.  any chance you could identify the line and i can help get it working?)@ebrevdo  It's [this ](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/translate) tutorial. The error is in [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/seq2seq_model.py#L122) cluster of lines. The cells passed here are used for both the backward and forward phase of the legacy seq2seq model, which throws an error because of same cells being used with different scopes.@iamgroot42 do you want to make a PR with the needed changes? That would be great, I currently don't have the cycles to do that myself. Thanks!I noticed that the TF 1.0  works fine with the newest version of translation tutorial if compiled from the source on branch remotes/origin/r1.0
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
$ cd tensorflow
$ git checkout remotes/origin/r1.0
```
then build and install TensorFlow, it works fine.

On branch remotes/origin/r1.1 it has the "different variable scope" error. 
I modified the code as @robmsylvester suggested
> What happens if you explicitly create the encoder cell AND the decoder cell in your seq2seq model file and pass both along to the legacy library file, making the small adjustments to the functions and their arguments?

and it works for me now.@oxwsds the Tensorflow I'm using is 1.0.1 so maybe that's having an error..

I had tried what @robmsylvester suggested then actually.. and the training had begun (2 days 13 hours done now).. it fails during decoding though with the error:
```

```
Did you try decoding?@prashantserai Don't exactly know, but what you met seems to be another issue. @prashantserai If it fails only when you decode, perhaps it has something to do with using a batch size of one? Does the model still train if you lower the batch size to one during training?@bowu Same error here. Mac OX Sierra, TensorFlow 1.1.0-rc1, Python 2.7.10 & Python 3.6.1.@robmsylvester it did train successfully with a batch size of one too, but failed during decoding in the same way or similar way.. here's a full traceback.. the reason I was thinking of this as a connected error was because of the reference to seq2seq_f (which was one of the modified functions) (the #prashant comment from my code to signify a modified line is part of the trace)

@oxwsds does your opinion change on the basis of the full trace above?@prashantserai I tried decoding and it works fine. I just simply add a `encoder_cell` arg to function `tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq` and in `translate/seq2seq_model.py` create the cell and pass it to the function, which were called in function `seq2seq_f`. How did you change your code?@oxwsds @robmsylvester @ebrevdo 
I finally have something that's working now (I mean, results for my single layer 256 unit network are kind of appalling, but that's probably just because the network is ultra light weight and I didn't tune params AT ALL)
Thank you so much everyone...!!!!!

_Here's my thoughts at the end of this:_

@oxwsds comment **that the tutorial (in it's current form) works without any need for modification when Tensorflow is compiled from the branch remotes/origin/r1.0 was TRUE**. Although, the sad bit was that the version of Tensorflow I had for which modifications within Tensorflow code were needed, and the version in remotes/origin/r1.0 were both identically labelled.

@robmsylvester 's fix in the comment (copied below) DID WORK for my version of Tensorflow where the Tutorial didn't work out of the box (and should work for TF 1.1 too I guess). It is slightly messy to implement, but I could do it, which is saying something :-P
The error in my last two comments before this was due to my mistake. Like a dummy, I was specifying the layers and hidden units parameters only during training, I was leaving the code to use defaults during decoding. **(this portion of the tutorial could be slightly more dummy proof: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq#lets_run_it )**

on pypi and at that tag? Gunhan, is that possible?

For information I had this issue while trying to stack LSTM cells:
My orginial code was:
```
    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(hidden_size, forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True)
    if is_training and keep_prob < 1:
      lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper(
          lstm_cell, output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
    cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell] * num_layers, state_is_tuple=True)
```

Then, with the following code, creating the model was ok, but I couldn't share the variable with another model. (for instance if you create a train_model and a valid_model supposed to share tensors, it will fail)
```
    lstm_creator = lambda: tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(
                                        hidden_size, 
                                        forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True)
    if is_training and keep_prob < 1:
      cell_creator = lambda:tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(
          lstm_creator(), output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
    else:
      cell_creator = lstm_creator

    cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([cell_creator() for _ in range(num_layers)], state_is_tuple=True)

```

So finally I used `lstm_creator` to be the function like `lstm_cell` in [tensorflow/models/tutorials/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py#L112](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py#L112). I now have:
```
def lstm_cell():
      # With the latest TensorFlow source code (as of Mar 27, 2017),
      # the BasicLSTMCell will need a reuse parameter which is unfortunately not
      # defined in TensorFlow 1.0. To maintain backwards compatibility, we add
      # an argument check here:
      if 'reuse' in inspect.getargspec(
          tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell.__init__).args:
        return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(
            size, forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True,
            reuse=tf.get_variable_scope().reuse)
      else:
        return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(
            size, forget_bias=0.0, state_is_tuple=True)
    attn_cell = lstm_cell
    
    lstm_creator = lstm_cell
    if is_training and keep_prob < 1:
      cell_creator = lambda:tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(
          lstm_creator(), output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
    else:
      cell_creator = lstm_creator

    cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([cell_creator() for _ in range(num_layers)], state_is_tuple=True)
```

It is now fully workingtrying to get this thing running, which results in the same error: 

https://gist.github.com/danijar/c7ec9a30052127c7a1ad169eeb83f159#file-blog_tensorflow_sequence_classification-py-L38


@pltrdy 's solution didn't do it for me oddly. I'm getting

```
ValueError: Variable rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/basic_lstm_cell/weights does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
```


@aep did you use the function of https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py#L112 I mention at the end of my post (now edited to be more clear)    cells=[]
    for _ in range(15):
        cell = create_lstm_cell(config)
        cells.append(cell)
    lsmt_layers = rnn.MultiRNNCell(cells)
it solved my problemManaged to fix this issue by installing older version of Tensorflow:
`pip install -Iv tensorflow==1.0`

I was receiving the error when executing the seq2seq tutorial
In regards to what @ebrevdo said, I think the solution is not to fix the legacy seq2seq code, but to update the tutorial to use the `contrib.seq2seq` package instead, which is actively maintained.  It is quite demoralizing when the first tensorflow program you ever run spits out a bunch of errors.  If I have some time this week, I'll submit a PR.
We're working on a new seq2seq tutorial. We had hoped to release by end of
last month but are getting delayed.  It will use the new API.

@ebrevdo I meet the same error when running the sequence_to_sequence model on the tensorflow1.1 website. And I have try to use 'reuse' parameter but failed. Could you tell me when the new seq2seq tutorial will be released?Looks like at the same time as tf 1.2, since we will rely on some new
features of that release.

@ebrevdo I am as well facing the same issue and unable to progress with seq2seq. It will be really helpful if you could let us/me know what is a probable date for a new tutorial.
Thanks a lot for your help.

Installing using `pip install tensorflow==1.0` (Tensorflow 1.0) is working for me (translate tutorial).I have version 1.1.0-rc2.TF1.2 will solve this problem? Please help me how to continue training the model. TF 1.0 works but doesn't have devicewrapper api for multiple GPUs.Having the same problem with tensor flow 1.1. Still working on a solution I tried several things, at the end I was able to use tensorflow 1.1 but had to make these changes: (based on Tshzzz above)

Remove this:
`multicell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([dropcell]*NLAYERS, state_is_tuple=False)`

And add this:
cells=[]
for _ in range(NLAYERS):
    cell = rnn.DropoutWrapper(tf.contrib.rnn.GRUCell(INTERNALSIZE), input_keep_prob=pkeep)
    cells.append(cell)
multicell = rnn.MultiRNNCell(cells, state_is_tuple=False)@ebrevdo Congratulations, TF 1.2 just got released - was the new tutorial also released somewhere or is it being released anytime soon?

ThanksWe'll plan to have an announcement when it's released. Working on it.

For anyone using tensorflow-gpu==1.1.0  and getting this error, switching to 1.0.0 via pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0 is not going to fix the problem, at least didn't work for me.

I ran into this issue on both mac and ubuntu and compiling from source worked both times. So:
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl@ajaanbaahu Still waiting for tf1.2 new seq2seq tutorial.It worked for me using `pip install tensorflow==1.0`.For tf r1.2, got deepcopy error. As listed in [sequence to sequence model error #1050](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/1050)As the rookie, I raise some of my opinion.
The following code will make this similar mistake occure:
(Piece of my code)
```python
lstm_cell = self.LSTMCell(self.num_hidden)
lstm_entity = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm_cell, output_keep_prob=0.5)
layer = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([lstm_entity] * self.num_layer)
__, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(layer, self.data, dtype=tf.float64)
```
The error dump as the following:
```

Please create a new instance of the cell if you would like it to use a different set of weights.  If before you were using: MultiRNNCell([BasicLSTMCell(...)] * num_layers), change to: MultiRNNCell([BasicLSTMCell(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]).  If before you were using the same cell instance as both the forward and reverse cell of a bidirectional RNN, simply create two instances (one for forward, one for reverse).  In May 2017, we will start transitioning this cell's behavior to use existing stored weights, if any, when it is called with scope=None (which can lead to silent model degradation, so this error will remain until then.)
```

But after I do the revision, It can work.
```python
"""
lstm_cell = self.LSTMCell(self.num_hidden)
lstm_entity = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm_cell, output_keep_prob=0.5)
layer = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([lstm_entity] * self.num_layer)
"""
layer = []
for i in range(self.num_layer):
    lstm_cell = self.LSTMCell(self.num_hidden)
    lstm_entity = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm_cell, output_keep_prob=0.5)
    layer.append(lstm_entity)
layer = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell(layer)
__, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(layer, self.data, dtype=tf.float64)
```None of those workarounds worked for me with Tensorflow 1.1

I'm using `seq2seq` model with `MultiRNNCell` cells.

I had to reverse back to 1.0.1: `pip3 install tensorflow==1.0`Anyone have these issues when working with legacy_seq2seq.rnn_decoder()? @oxwsds As you said, I change input args cell of tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq to two different cell {encoder_cells, decoder_cells}. Finally, I get seq2seq model worked.  After 73200 setps, I get perplexity 5.54.
Then I run decode part, 
 >> Who is the president of the United States?
Qui est le président des États-Unis ?

Problem solved.  Thanks.@doncat99 
It seems that `copy.deepcopy(cell)`  in `seq2seq.py`  doesn't make effect.
So I change the related part in `seq2seq_model.py` to 

```
if num_layers > 1:
      cell_enc = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([single_cell() for _ in range(num_layers)])
      cell_dec = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([single_cell() for _ in range(num_layers)])

    # The seq2seq function: we use embedding for the input and attention.
    def seq2seq_f(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, do_decode):
      return seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(
          encoder_inputs,
          decoder_inputs,
          cell_enc,
          cell_dec,
          num_encoder_symbols=source_vocab_size,

```@supermeatboy82 , Could you share your code?

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update'
I also met the error caused by `copy.deepcopy(cell)` in `embedding_attention_seq2seq()` when running `self_test()` in the translate model in tutorial. 
I tried to change the codes in `seq2seq_f()` in `Seq2SeqModel` as follows:

```
    def seq2seq_f(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, do_decode=False):
        tmp_cell = copy.deepcopy(cell) #new
        return tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(
            encoder_inputs,
            decoder_inputs,
            tmp_cell, #new
            num_encoder_symbols=source_vocab_size,
            num_decoder_symbols=target_vocab_size,
            embedding_size=size,
            output_projection=output_projection,
            feed_previous=do_decode,
            dtype=dtype)
```
Then there is no error now.
BUT as a rookie I don't know whether the codes here work as before and it seems the changes make the model run slower.
I would like to update everyone that I downgraded the tensorflow to 1.0.0 (tensorflow-GPU) and it is working for me. The models are performing as expected. I assume that the CPU version of 1.0.0 should function as expected? Or?.
Thanks :)
Hi guys, I don't know if you're still interested on it, but I found that the problem is related to the operation of copying the cell passed as params to the `embedding_attention_seq2seq` function. This is because the same cell definition is used both for encoder and decoder. I think the tutorial is deprecated since it uses a seq2seq model with bucketing in contrast to a dynamic seq2seq. But, I'm pasting a modified function that works. The function is updated in the file `tensorflow/contrib/legacy_seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py`.

thanks,
Fabio

  """Embedding sequence-to-sequence model with attention.

  This model first embeds encoder_inputs by a newly created embedding (of shape
  [num_encoder_symbols x input_size]). Then it runs an RNN to encode
  embedded encoder_inputs into a state vector. It keeps the outputs of this
  RNN at every step to use for attention later. Next, it embeds decoder_inputs
  by another newly created embedding (of shape [num_decoder_symbols x
  input_size]). Then it runs attention decoder, initialized with the last
  encoder state, on embedded decoder_inputs and attending to encoder outputs.

  Warning: when output_projection is None, the size of the attention vectors
  and variables will be made proportional to num_decoder_symbols, can be large.

  Args:
    encoder_inputs: A list of 1D int32 Tensors of shape [batch_size].
    decoder_inputs: A list of 1D int32 Tensors of shape [batch_size].
    cell: tf.nn.rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
    num_encoder_symbols: Integer; number of symbols on the encoder side.
    num_decoder_symbols: Integer; number of symbols on the decoder side.
    embedding_size: Integer, the length of the embedding vector for each symbol.
    num_heads: Number of attention heads that read from attention_states.
    output_projection: None or a pair (W, B) of output projection weights and
      biases; W has shape [output_size x num_decoder_symbols] and B has
      shape [num_decoder_symbols]; if provided and feed_previous=True, each
      fed previous output will first be multiplied by W and added B.
    feed_previous: Boolean or scalar Boolean Tensor; if True, only the first
      of decoder_inputs will be used (the "GO" symbol), and all other decoder
      inputs will be taken from previous outputs (as in embedding_rnn_decoder).
      If False, decoder_inputs are used as given (the standard decoder case).
    dtype: The dtype of the initial RNN state (default: tf.float32).
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to
      "embedding_attention_seq2seq".
    initial_state_attention: If False (default), initial attentions are zero.

      states.

        outputs.
      state: The state of each decoder cell at the final time-step.

```@fabiofumarola Thank you for the function. Looks really helpful. I also saw that the tutorial is deprecated. I am still waiting for an official tutorial release. Looks like you have used the new api. Do you have any code that can be looked up to start coding on the new api?
Any help is well appreciated. Thank you once again :)@syw2014 Did you fix your issue?@w268wang not yet, still waiting for other solutions, but  comments  of @Miopas may  have a try, and I am trying the solution of @fabiofumarola it says `TypeError: embedding_attention_seq2seq() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dec_cell' `
after using the update that @fabiofumarola posted. Can you guys please help me?
Yes because the update I have proposed require you to change the
embedding_attention_seq2seq Function. If you go to the source file in you
tensorflow release you can change the method definition you re self.

Yes i did the same thing. I changed the function in seq2seq.py file in the tensorflow release. Still i am getting the same error. Is there one more argument to the function?Yes, now in you code you need to specify to rnn_cells. One for the encoder
and another for the decoder.

I am totally new to this. Maybe this a pretty basic question but could you tell what argument to be passed as the decoder cell in this code? I am trying to develop the seq2seq as shown in the tensorflow tutorial using own dataset.

Okay! thanks though! :)@ebrevdo  is there any update on when the new tutorial of seq2seq using new api will come out?
Thank you. Amazing work!.
yeah waiting for the new tutorial... would be great to know if it's planned to be released anytime soon.. @ebrevdo 

tried to take code in the kernel tests and retrofit the beam search with the legacy seq2seq, but it was challenging...We're hoping for this coming week!

Hi guys,

Any update to this issue, I'm experiencing the same on tensorflow 1.1-gpu for mac os x@tshi1983 
I got the same problem with tensorflow 1.1-gpu for ubuntu. 
I upgrade to tf 1.2. It still doesn't work. 
Then I change the function embedding_attention_seq2seq in file 
tensorflow/contrib/legacy_seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py
to the one as @fabiofumarola suggested above. 
Now it starts training. I haven't tested decoding yet. 
Move the code on cell definition into seq2seq_f:

```
def seq2seq_f(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, do_decode):
      def single_cell():
        return tf.contrib.rnn.GRUCell(size)
      if use_lstm:
        def single_cell():
          return tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(size)
      cell = single_cell()
      if num_layers > 1:

      return tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(

	  )
```
Then "python translate.py --data_dir data/ --train_dir checkpoint/ --size=256 --num_layers=2 --steps_per_checkpoint=50" can work.

@huxuanlai it works! At least it's training now, thx!@huxuanlai Works for me as well.  I am receiving the same `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update'` but with `tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.model_with_buckets`. I am running tf 1.2.1 (GPU)  on ubuntu 16.04 lts.

This only seems to occur when I have more than 1 bucket.

```@Tshzzz @jtubert 
thx, your solution worked for me. My tf verstion is 1.1.0.

I changed from:
```python
    lstm_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(HIDDEN_SIZE, state_is_tuple=True)
    cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell() for _ in range(NUM_LAYERS)])
    output, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, X, dtype=tf.float32)  
```
to:
```python
    cells=[]
    for _ in range(NUM_LAYERS):
        cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(HIDDEN_SIZE, state_is_tuple=True)
        cells.append(cell)
    multicell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell(cells, state_is_tuple=True)
    output, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(multicell, X, dtype=tf.float32)
```
This is still not fixed , tried all possible solutions , ones mentioned in this thread and stackoverflow , it doesn't work with tensorflow 1.3 or 1.2 or 1.1 I'm facing this error:
```TypeError: embedding_attention_seq2seq() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dec_cell' ```

The error points to this function in seq2seq_model.py which is line 142 in seq2seq_model.py:

  ```def seq2seq_f(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, do_decode):
      return tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(
          encoder_inputs,
          decoder_inputs,
          cell,
          num_encoder_symbols=source_vocab_size,
          num_decoder_symbols=target_vocab_size,
          embedding_size=size,
          output_projection=output_projection,
          feed_previous=do_decode,
          dtype=dtype) 
```


Anyone who came across with this error and managed  to solve this, please help me correct this issue.ValueError: Attempt to reuse RNNCell <tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops.core_rnn_cell_impl.GRUCell object at 0x11d32cbd0> with a different variable scope than its first use. First use of cell was with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell', this attempt is with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_1/gru_cell'. Please create a new instance of the cell if you would like it to use a different set of weights. If before you were using: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...)] * num_layers), change to: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]). If before you were using the same cell instance as both the forward and reverse cell of a bidirectional RNN, simply create two instances (one for forward, one for reverse). In May 2017, we will start transitioning this cell's behavior to use existing stored weights, if any, when it is called with scope=None (which can lead to silent model degradation, so this error will remain until then.)

the origin code:
from tensorflow.contrib import rnn
inputs = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[None, None], name="inputs")
keep_prob = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, name="keep_prob")
cell = rnn.GRUCell(10)
cell = rnn.DropoutWrapper(cell=cell, input_keep_prob=keep_prob)
cell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([cell for _ in range(5)], state_is_tuple=True)

  outs, states = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=cell, inputs=look_up, dtype=tf.float32)
solution:
inputs = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[None, None], name="inputs")
keep_prob = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, name="keep_prob")
cell = rnn.MultiRNNCell([rnn.DropoutWrapper(rnn.GRUCell(10), input_keep_prob=keep_prob) for _ in range(5)] , state_is_tuple=True)Do you have this issue with the tf nightlies?

It has been 14 days with no activity and the `awaiting tensorflower` label was assigned. Please update the label and/or status accordingly.Nagging Awaiting TensorFlower: It has been 14 days with no activityand the `awaiting tensorflower` label was assigned. Please update the label and/or status accordingly.The solution is to move to a newer version of TF.  This thread has drastically diverged from its original issue.  Closing.If you want instant solution you can try what i tried : 

`pip install tensorflow==1.0
`
The issue is with tenorflow 1.1 version , it worked for me.
