Hi,

I am new to Python and Anaconda. I installed anaconda and install Scipy. When I try import scipy in the  Python in command prompt on the Anaconda prompt, it works fine as below 

```
[Anaconda3] C:\Users\me>python
Python 3.5.1 |Anaconda 4.0.0 (64-bit)| (default, Feb 16 2016, 09:49:46) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import scipy
>>>
```

But when I use the same in the Jupyter notebook, I am getting -

```
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-4dc45f4c0083> in <module>()
----> 1 import scipy

ImportError: No module named 'scipy'
```

Please let me know how to solve this issue.
Usually that indicates that the notebook is running with a different Python or in a different environment from Python in the command prompt. Check `sys.executable` to see which Python it's running in, and `sys.path` to see where it's looking for imports.
Thanks takluyver,

I see the difference. The path from the command prompt shows

> > > sys.executable
> > > 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3\python.exe'

Where as the notebook shows
'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3\envs\py35\python.exe'

I had installed py27 and py35 on my system. Can you please let me know how to change to path which is used in command prompt.
try a `conda install ipykernel --name Python3`,  `python -m ipykernel install`. That will likely fix the notebook can see your Python 3 kernel. Then create a `new` >`Python3 notebook` from the dashboard. 
~~Hi, I'm encountering the same problem here. I've installed successfully tensorflow and anaconda on my Mac OS. Everything goes fine in spyder, while when programming in Jupyter notebook, some modules seem to be not exist and cannot be imported. "Error: no module name matplotlib, scipy....."~~

~~Then I checked the system and found:
In spyder, sys.executable is "/Users/abc/anaconda/bin/python";
In Jupyter, sys.executable is "/Users/abc/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/bin/python" (no matter whether I activate tensorflow in  terminal)~~

~~Both python version are 2.7.11. Now I want to change the python path in Jupyter to which spyder uses. Can anyone please tell me how to do this? Thanks a lot.~~

See separate issue: #1580
```
$ /Users/abc/anaconda/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel
$ /Users/abc/anaconda/bin/python -m  ipykernel install
```
It works! Thank you so much for your help, really saved my life!

Happy coding !
I tried doing what Carreau suggested and although I was able to then import scipy it made it so I could now no longer import matplotlib which I could previously....
You have one Python environment with scipy installed but not matplotlib, and one with matplotlib installed but not Scipy. Whichever one you pick, you'll have to work out how to install the missing package into it, using conda or pip.

I have a similar problem. My problem is that when I launch my anaconda environment and access to Python script. the next line works well:
                          from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
but when I execute the same line in jupyter notebook or spyder(both in anaconda), the error occur.

In Python script, the sys.executable:'/home/lqq/anaconda2/envs/tfgpu/bin/python'

My jupyter notebook and spyder have same sys.executable:'/home/lqq/anaconda2/bin/python'

I use the command that @Carreau provideï¼Œbut only the first one runs well. In second, the error message is:
               [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/share/jupyter'


Use `--help`  and look at the informations:

```
$ /path/to/python -m  ipykernel install --help
usage: ipython-kernel-install [-h] [--user] [--name NAME]
                              [--display-name DISPLAY_NAME]
                              [--profile PROFILE] [--prefix PREFIX]
                              [--sys-prefix]

Install the IPython kernel spec.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --user                Install for the current user instead of system-wide
  --name NAME           Specify a name for the kernelspec. This is needed to
                        have multiple IPython kernels at the same time.
  --display-name DISPLAY_NAME
                        Specify the display name for the kernelspec. This is
                        helpful when you have multiple IPython kernels.
  --profile PROFILE     Specify an IPython profile to load. This can be used
                        to create custom versions of the kernel.
  --prefix PREFIX       Specify an install prefix for the kernelspec. This is
                        needed to install into a non-default location, such as
                        a conda/virtual-env.
  --sys-prefix          Install to Python's sys.prefix. Shorthand for
                        --prefix='/Users/bussonniermatthias/anaconda'. For use
                        in conda/virtual-envs.
```

A `--user` flag is available. Or, if you know what your doing, use `sudo` to install with administrator permission.Thank you @Carreau ! I had solved this problem!
Eh,,,I just reinstall the imgaug under the anaconda environment,then,it worked OK,,,sounds like a joke,hahaha,,,
Thank you for your sincerity!Carreau,
 I have similar problem. I high light our old HDP version 2.4.2.0-258 on the screen below, but we have the new HDP version 2.6, Looks like jupyter pick up the sys.path automatically, where I can find this Jupyter sys.path and what this sys.path name so that I can change this sys.path and get the correct python package

Thannk you for your quick response

<img width="816" alt="jupyter_python_hdp" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25250352/31548777-b000f132-aff1-11e7-8fb4-f8d1a80bb9ca.png">

 
You can manipulate `sys.path` inside Python, e.g.

```python
sys.path.remove('/path/you/dont/want')
sys.path.append('/path/you/do/want')
```

It can also be affected by the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable when Jupyter is started.Great, answers above. I just create symlinks between respective system path and anaconda installation of python, for e.g. 
```
1. get system path !which python2; if the returned path is `/usr/bin/python2`
2. sudo ln -s /home/anaconda2/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python2
```
this helps me moving from different versions of the python and making the notebooks work consistently.Hi, same issue here.
Another approach is to install jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook) with "conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab" after the environment's activation; I mean, inside the environment, so that the jupyter lab runs on this environment and not on root.
May be it's not so much elegant, but is another way and works.i ran the following commands up above because it had up votes and it broke my ability to launch a jupyter notebook and killed that environment costing me hours of time to rebuild all the installs. Its unlikely someone will see this before they try it but in case they do

`try a conda install ipykernel --name Python3, python -m ipykernel install. That will likely fix the notebook can see your Python 3 kernel. Then create a new >Python3 notebook from the dashboard.`
i have this error please help

how do i resolve this?Following is outcome of my terminal window:

Following is the output of jupyter notebook:

I think issue is with virtualenv ComputerVision ..How to fix this ?


So what is the exact solution? I am working on a linux and can't find any documentation from the anaconda and jupyter community. 

$ python --version

What are the next steps?

I was having the same problem.  I also have the Anaconda navigator installed. I solved the issue from there.

1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. find "Environments" tab in the top left corner, click on it.
3. You will see a long list of packages.  Click  the "Update index..." button at the top of the list.  

This solved my issueTo install package in jupyter notebook use following instructions:

i can't import it in jupyter..i need some helphttps://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints/issues/13#issuecomment-462085023solved it, in my case
```sh

>Using virtualenv or conda envs, you can make your IPython kernel in one env available to Jupyter in a different env. To do so, run ipykernel install from the kernelâ€™s env, with â€“prefix pointing to the Jupyter env:
Solved it. 

Run `jupyter kernelspec list` in the terminal, or run `import sys; sys.executable` in an opened jupyter-notebook to see which interpreter it is using, and then we can manually delete these interpreters. Jupyter will then automatically find the other default interpreters (the ones with the right packages correctly installed)> try a `conda install ipykernel --name Python3`, `python -m ipykernel install`. That will likely fix the notebook can see your Python 3 kernel. Then create a `new` >`Python3 notebook` from the dashboard.
 
works perfectly @Carreau 

> try a conda install ipykernel --name Python3, python -m ipykernel install. That will likely fix the notebook can see your Python 3 kernel. Then create a new >Python3 notebook from the dashboard.


apart from the fact that I had to specify the specific python version.

i.e. 'python -m ipykernel install' changes to:

python3.7 -m ipykernel install. 

As I have python3.7 installed on my machine.

Typing python alone reverts back to python2.7.

Thumbs up from me!! 
just upgrade your jupyter notebook : 

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterI have the same problem by importing ROOT CERN on centos with anaconda and **jupyterhub** perfectly woking on command prompt but not working in the notebook

> ImportErrorTraceback (most recent call last)
> <ipython-input-1-ee8dc4376aa8> in <module>()
> ----> 1 import ROOT
> 
> ImportError: No module named ROOT

following the idea of this post I have temporary solved the problem for python3 (default in my coda installation) by the following path added directly before calling the module

```
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/local/root/build")
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/local/root/build/lib")
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/local/root/build/etc/notebook")
import ROOT
```

it' not clear to me how to make it permanent, any help? I got @Carreau 's suggestion to work by doing:
`python -m ipykernel install`> Usually that indicates that the notebook is running with a different Python or in a different environment from Python in the command prompt. Check `sys.executable` to see which Python it's running in, and `sys.path` to see where it's looking for imports.

When I switch to Python 3 kernel, it still shows /usr/bin/python, which is python2.

So I had to run the following to make everything work

> python2 -m pip install ipykernel
> python2 -m ipykernel install --user
> 
> python3 -m pip install ipykernel
> python3 -m ipykernel install --user> > Usually that indicates that the notebook is running with a different Python or in a different environment from Python in the command prompt. Check `sys.executable` to see which Python it's running in, and `sys.path` to see where it's looking for imports.

Did it work for you? I am facing a similar issue.@nikhilrsharma I create a virtual environment in anaconda, then I solve this problem.
https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/

After installing the virtual environment,
every time when you open the terminal: you should command: 

`$ source activate _yourEnvName_`

then run the jupyter notebook on your virtual environment. command:  `$ jupyter notebook`

If you want to pip install any package, you should install 2 times:
the first one is in the terminal: `$ pip install something`
the second time is to enter the virtual environment: `$ source activate _yourEnvName_`
and  `$ pip install something`Thank You so much "takluyver"

Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!You are executing your notebook inside an Anaconda environment. Try the following:

`conda install -n curr_env scipy`  where curr_env is your Anaconda environment name.Hi @thirumalaipm I had the same issue, this is what worked for me.
1. Check python version on your terminal/cmd/powershell.
2. Check version on your Jupyter notebook.

**They both need to be the same.**

In order to check whether you are having module installed. Type ```help('modules')```, and find the module you are trying to work with.
If it is listed there, it means it is installed.

Then there might be some ambiguity in your Python path or version conflict(mentioned at top) as I was having.ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

please solve this error Please see [this comment from above](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1524#issuecomment-225010572).  The code that is running this import statement is running from an environment that is likely different than the python in which notebook server is running (assuming that import works fine from the command line).  My guess is that pymatsolver should be updated in your base user env.**Problem :** Import on Jupyter notebook failed where command prompt works.
**Reason :** This problem usually occurs when your cmd prompt is using different python and Anaconda/jupyter is using different.
**Solution :**  Follow the following steps :-

1. Run this code in cmd prompt and jupyter notebook and note the output paths. It will probably be different.
`import sys `
`sys.executable`

2. Run this cmd in jupyter notebook.
`!jupyter kernelspec list`
 --> Go to that directory and open kernel.json file.
