It used to work fine until I changed python to lower version today(3.7 to 3.6). The jupyter notebook keeps giving me blank page when started. I changed the version back and it doesn't help. No error in the terminal. The error in the browser are as follows:

I check some other posts which said to clean browser caches and cookies which doesn't help for my case. Any idea about how to fix this problem?Me too, with python3.7 at windows10.
And from the log, there's a 302 redirect record:
[I 01:04:46.632 NotebookApp] 302 GET /tree (::1) 1.00ms
I guess the localhost address is redirected to ::1.I have the same issue , python3.7 ,win10 > Me too, with python3.7 at windows10.

We have exactly the same problem in here.Same issue here on Python 3.7.2, experienced on both Chrome (before and after clearing cache) and on Microsoft Edge. The issue appears to be that Jupyter's webserver is returning `Content-Type: text/plain` for main.min.js and all other JS files, which causes browsers to reject loading them under MIME checks. 

Edit: It's most likely that this is an issue with the latest changelog item, which involves Content Type option changes:
```
5.7.6
-----

5.7.6 contains a security fix for a cross-site inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability,
where files at a known URL could be included in a page from an unauthorized website if the user is logged into a Jupyter server.
The fix involves setting the ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff``
header, and applying CSRF checks previously on all non-GET
API requests to GET requests to API endpoints and the /files/ endpoint.

The attacking page is able to access some contents of files when using Internet Explorer through script errors,
but this has not been demonstrated with other browsers.
A CVE has been requested for this vulnerability.
```

Edit 2: Opened a PR with a quick fix.@ciaranlangton Hey, thanks for the update but here is the strange thing. I tried the latest version (5.7.6) on another pc and it works fine. I also tried to modify the notebookapp.py as your pr but it doesn't fix the problem. So I am thinking about there might be something else.@andrewsunst sorry to hear that it didn't fix it, is the other PC a Windows based machine? Plus, when you applied the patch, did you clear cache (either explicitly through browser options or CTRL+F5). It would also be helpful if you could see what the `Content-Type` header is on the working PC for the JavaScript filesWell actually, it works after I clean the cache! So for the one that works, I don't exactlly know what do you suggest to take a look at. Is that something from the browser? If so then it is as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17963616/54096963-835a7b80-4384-11e9-93f9-222437ec9969.png)
You can check the Content-Type in Chrome by switching to the Network tab at
the top of the debug console, and then refreshing the page (ideally with a
CTRL F5). The files and requests will be visible in a list to the right,
select any .js file from there, and then on the left there will be a pane
containing a lot of information, under “Response Headers” you should see
 Content-Type: ......
So I followed your procedure and found the content-type in only one of the .js files which is http://localhost:8888/static/tree/js/main.min.js?. The content-type appears as 
`E.setRequestHeader("Content-Type",h.contentType)` 
and I checked the value of it which I think is as follows
 `return utils.promising_ajax(this.api_url(), {
            processData: false,
            type : "PATCH",
            data: JSON.stringify(newdata),
            dataType : "json",
            contentType: 'application/json',
        }`
The other one is `contentType:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"`. So is there anything we can get from these?Still same problem. Blank page in either Chrome, or Opera. Either file tree page, or notebooks pages.
Got message in the console after attempt F5 or Ctrl+F5
`[I 11:27:26.543 NotebookApp] 302 GET /?token=3023f5b77855d20b9cba73dd0036e2a7a4df1c1c77fcae77 (::1) 1.00ms`

in browser.
Win10 1809 17763.348, latest Chrome 72.0.3626.121, python 3.7.1. By the way, downgrading jupyter and it's separate components, included ipython, with pip, make file tree page visible, but notebook page still blank.
P.S. ipython notebook shows the same behavior.I am having the same identical issue here. Both with python 3.6.8 and python 3.7.1. Browsers: Opera, Brave and Microsoft EdgeSame Problem here. Python 3.7.2 and Jupyter notebook 5.7.6. Tried Firefox, Chrome, Opera and EdgeI have the exact same problem, any solutions yet?I am struggling with the same problemI have same problem with Chrome and Edge. I have Python 3.6.4 and Jupyter 4.4.0.  I'm having the same issue with both chrome and firefox. Tried clearing the cache, but it didn't resolve the issue for me. Python 3.7.2 and Jupyter 4.4.0, installed via pip.Same problem for me.
Downgraded notebook to 5.7.4, now it is working.
So do
pip uninstall notebook
pip install notebook==5.7.5
edit: use 5.7.5 instead of 5.7.4, see below> Same problem for me.

Worked, I'm am using 5.7.5 
Thank you!Yep, when using 5.7.4 there are issues with tornado version 6 (kernel not connecting).
Use 5.7.5 (as alvaroqueiroz suggested), it works with tornado 6.
So instead do (after uninstalling notebook):
pip install notebook==5.7.5> Yep, when using 5.7.4 there are issues with tornado version 6 (kernel not connecting).

Thanks a lot !! Now kernel is running.@andrewsunst thanks for getting back with that, I think I was maybe a bit unclear about my instructions (I was working from a mental image of the debug console). Here's an image with the fields and options highlighted.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6655339/54142154-04665100-441f-11e9-89d6-50207a3404dc.png)

I think it's rather safe to say though that the issue is caused by the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` added in the last version, given by @LukasLuMueller and other's rollback attempts, as well as the error message in the browser. I doubt doing the above operation is really worthwhile anymore.

Hopefully the PR can get merged so this issue can be fixed and people can also benefit from the security changes in the latest patch. I'd also appreciate it if anyone else is willing to test the patch that is experiencing this issue and provide feedback if it fixes the issue for them (after clearing browser cache)@ciaranlangton So I checked the Content-type of the .js files in headers and they are `application/javascript`.Trying on edge, i get this on powershell (txt file) and this curious message

In w10 I have the same problem but it does not solve only with this. To solve it, I went to the directory "**AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Lib\site-packages\notebook\templates**" and edit the file "**page.html**" on line 18, changing the double quotes with single quotes.

It's work for me. Note version 5.7.6 to 5.7.5.
Thanks a lot.
Same problem, downgrade to 5.7.5 and then do ctrl+shift+r to refresh the page works !For anyone who installs with Anaconda the equivalent fix is:

works for me, thxI found on windows it uses win registry HKCR/.js/Content-Type as the content-type for js files. It's text/plain on my computer.
Changing it to text/javascript fixed it.> > It didnt work for me, tryed 5.7.4 and 5.7.3. It worked for everyone?

same thing worked on my windows machine, I initially had gotten blank page with jupyter notebook and even re-install didnt fix the issue initially... but when I followed this registry edit advice, then the jupyter notebook opened regularly...>

Thanks..
Work for me.. Win10 Python 3.6.8Changing the registry fixed it for me as well:

1. In the windows menu, search for `regedit`, open it.
1. Navigate to Computer > HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT > .js > ContentType
1. Change value data to `text/javascript`
1. Restart `jupyter notebook`. 
1. Go to browser (chrome) type `chrome:restart`, and it worked. Hard refresh might work to.> Changing the registry fixed it for me as well:

Great thanks for the instructions. 
---------------short summary ------------
Win 8, python 3.6.8.
1. Installed Jupyter Notebook 5.7.6 with the blank page as a result.
2. uninstalled Jupyter Notebook 5.7.6, after that installed 5.7.5. Works properly.
3. Uninstalled 5.7.5 after that installed 5.7.6
4. Changed ContentType in registry
5. Ctrl+F5 in Opera with opened page
6. It works! Works!! nice)
I have created easy-to-import windows registry file to solve this problem in one click. [https://github.com/Palladiumm/Jupyter-Notebook-5.7.6-win-blank-page-solution-js-reg-file](https://github.com/Palladiumm/Jupyter-Notebook-5.7.6-win-blank-page-solution-js-reg-file)@Palladiumm , Why are we fixing bugs in Jupyter notebook with registry hacks?> @Palladiumm , Why are we fixing bugs in Jupyter notebook with registry hacks?
IMHO,it is one of the ways to solve this problem rapidly without downgrading Jupyter Notebook to lower version
pip uninstall notebook
pip install notebook==5.7.5I think there's only 2 good solutions for this problem.
1. Revert the changes. Imho a bug like this should be immediately reverted if it can't be fixed the same day
2. Fix it in code

I think there could be made some improvements to release management in a product that's used as often as Jupyter Notebook. Things like this shouldn't be open for 2+ weeks.> Same problem for me.

Got the same problem, and solved by this solution. Thanks!use notebook==5.7.5
below Use notebook==5.7.5 and also clear the cache.The fix for this has been released as 5.7.7For those using Conda, run the following command and update to notebook version 5.7.7

`conda install notebook`

Worked for me as well :)Had similar issue with 5.7.6, updated to 5.7.7 issue resolvedThis issues seems to occur in 5.7.8 as well.

Update: Okay, it seems to be working again in 5.7.8. Had to clear my cache.None of these fixes worked for me, but changing my default port to something besides 8888 worked. I do a lot of work on AWS where I tunnel into that port to use Jupyter notebook, so that must have had something to do with it. Even with that connection closed though, my local notebook on 8888 didn't want to load and I was getting the same errors as above.For me it was clearing the cacherunning notebook in aws, after login i get a 302. help????????@lanwww I am running into the same issue.  Was running from an ec2 instance and port forwarding, and now I am running into this 302 issue on my Mac. removing the config folder: ~/.jupyter/ solved it for me. > Same problem for me.

Good job man. It works!I also had the same problem. steps I followed. "conda install jupyterlab"
thats all, then it asked me for rebuild, did that and jupyter lab working fine.
