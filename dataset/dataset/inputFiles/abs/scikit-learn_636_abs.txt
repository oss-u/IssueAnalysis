I first noticed this when running 'make test' hanged. I tried with stable and bleeding edge scipy I initially thought it was something arpack related. The test CODESCODES hangs the process. Running in IPython something like CODESCODES hangs as well. I thought maybe there was something wrong with my setup, but CODESCODES works OK with CODESCODES. Under linux or windows? Mac OS X Lion 10. can anybody reproduce? Not in the same session because the process needs to be killed, but it works in an identical IPython session in the same virtualenv. I don't really know how to debug this, I'll try some prints to see where it hangs. Vlad.

The exact same code runs when CODESCODES ie. avoiding the special branch that bypasses the call to CODESCODES when CODESCODES. The interesting part though I haven't checked this extensively is that this happens in all 3 of my virtualenvs: stable numpy&scipy, git head numpy&scipy and scipy superpack. Any ideas?

I'm trying to run scikit learn for the first time on my Mac and am getting a hang on CODESCODES also. Mac OS X Lion 10. Python latest scikit learn master from Github, virtualenv, numpy 1. scipy 0.10. I haven't tried gdb or anything yet. I'll be at the PyData Workshop tomorrow Saturday in case someone is there and wants to poke around on my computer. I did a Git bisect to narrow it down: CODELCODEL. So far I have been unable to get GDB working with Python. This probably isn't useful, but here's what I get when I Ctrl C it after it hangs: CODELCODEL. Ok so the git bisect tells us that this bug was introduced at the same time as we introduce the parallel kmeans feature itself. The python stacktrace might tell use that there is a race condition in multiprocessing: this might be related: to LINKLINK which has been fixed in python 3 but maybe not backported in python 2. By the way vene and njwilson, which versions of python are you using? Edit: I mean exactly, such as CODESCODES. I'm using Python 2. Same here. I could never reproduce this race condition. So this might not be linked to an already backported python bugfix. How many cores CPUs do you have on your machine? I am running a dual core machine. Same. Dual core. njwilson can you try to checkout and build this branch and see if you can still reproduce the issue? LINKLINK. cython profiling seems to be messing around with python threads and I have heard recently that python forking and the the python threads are not good friends: LINKLINK. I tried the no kmeans profile branch and the problem still exists. cournape and I tracked the bug down to a segfault in Grand Central Dispatch on the BLAS DGEMM function only after a fork: LINKLINK. I have just reported the issue to Apple. Hopefully it will be fixed at some point. In the mean time we will have to skip this test on OSX I think. Wow, great work! Let's hope they are responsive. On Mar 13, 2012, at 09:51, Olivier Grisel wrote: Now on Mountain Lion I don't get hanging but I get random segfaults in the CODESCODES. This is the output: LINKLINK. I assume this is the same bug ogrisel and cournape found, that Apple confirmed as expected behaviour you can't call accelerate in subprocesses. Can I compile my own parallel, optimized blas and lapack then? Did anybody do this on Lion or Mountain Lion because I can't find much about this endeavour. Accelerate can be called after a fork but you need to execv the subprocess with the python binary which multiprocessing does not do under posix. I think cournape is working on a numpy build that uses LINKLINK and that could server as a good alternative for Accelerate even though early benchmark should a slight decrease in performances. So is there any way we can avoid these problems on OS X? Can we check the blas before trying to do something in parallel? I think cournape would like to make it possible to switch the blas lapack implementation for numpy at runtime but that might be pretty tricky to implement and will obviously only be available in some undetermined future version of numpy if ever. I don't know if we can detect whether the Blas in used is linked to Accelerate and issue a warning in joblib prior to forking in that case. Hm. ok probably there is no chance really. should we just add this to the docs as a known issue in OS X? thumbs up it never hurts to document stuff. does anybody know if EPD on osx produces the same bug? I use EPD with MKL on my mac and I've never had a problem so I would. say no until I'm proved wrong. I added a warning in bd3a6c2fcc3ea15ba17b1e2c9946c81f1f0b05a9. ogrisel vene could you please check that it is accurate? Should we close this issue or leave it open? FYI there is a similar issue with OpenBLAS. I just reported here: xianyi OpenBLAS 294. I'm having the same issue with Ubuntu here. It was working a few days ago. uname a: Linux 3.0 29 generic 42 Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 13 19:40:39 UTC 2013 x86 64 x86 64 x86 64 GNU Linux. python version. Python 2. CODELCODEL. Recent upgrades via apt get. Commit Log for Sun Sep 1 13:30:29 2013. Installed the following packages: libblas dev 1.20110419 5. liblapack dev 3.2 thumbs down exp3. liblapack doc 3.2 thumbs down exp3. liblapacke 3.2 thumbs down exp3. liblapacke dev 3.2 thumbs down exp3. KMeans with n jobs 2 hangs, cross validation with n jobs 2 runs. That's weird. I recently pushed efa74b491ed46427abe12a76ad4629dfae8a77d4 to master but that was to skip this test if openblas is used, so it should not be the problem. Still can you try to checkout a past version using git log and retry to check whether this commit is the source of the regression? You cannot CODESCODES easily because of the hanging behavior so manually check is probably required. Also what is the output of: CODELCODEL. on your box? CODELCODEL. That's odd, I thought I installed Atlas. I need to reinstall numpy right? Weird. Maybe numpy is confused. I just checked on a up to date Ubuntu 13.04 machine and if I install CODESCODES I get the following output: CODELCODEL. Note that the headers seem to be required: if I uninstall the headers from CODESCODES while keeping the dynamic library from the package CODESCODES then I see the line: CODELCODEL. Basically it switches back to the symlinks to the non optimized versions of BLAS and LAPACK. So the dev headers are effectively a runtime dependency for optimized numpy under Ubuntu. Just to confirm what I just said: CODELCODEL. Thanks for that, it got me on the right track. I followed the instructions LINKLINK and it appears to work. Hanging on a clean install with Anaconda on a new i7 Mabook Pro Retina and Mavericks. Which version of scikit learn? We believe that we have fixed this in. master. Hey GaelVaroquaux, I'm using scikit learn 0.14.1 np17py27 1 from Anaconda. kevindavenport can you please give us the output of: CODELCODEL. If you have gdb installed, can you also try? CODELCODEL. ogrisel Thanks for your help. The dedication you guys have to this project is incredible! CODELCODEL. I found an article stating how I can install gdb with homebrew: CODELCODEL. but I also read gdb has been replaced by lldb, and is no longer supported. gcc and llvm gcc are also gone, replaced by clang. Alright: anaconda is apparently linked against OSX vecLib instead of MKL or Atlas which causes the issue. Therefore this is the same issue as previously. We don't have any clean solution for this in the short term besides advising you to build Atlas from source to use that instead of vecLib. Peter Wang from continuum states that they build against Apple Accelerate Framework. Do any of you guys have experience with pointing my environment to Atlas instead? Maybe CODESCODES is lying then? Anyway the freeze looks real and AFAIK MKL is fork safe. Numpy developers started working on a binary package for numpy on OSX that builds against an embedded Atlas that does not suffer from this bug, this the comments in numpy numpy 4007. If this experiment is validated a such numpy whl packages get published on PyPI we can close this bug and re enable the skipped tests for future versions of numpy. A few months ago I decided to just conda install MKL LINKLINK which would make my python install use the Intel MKL optimizations over the built in accelerate framework. This let me use the parallel features of joblib in scikit, but recently the anaconda 2.0 and or numpy upgrade broke it again. Everything checks out here though: CODELCODEL. CODELCODEL. This is bad news. Can you confirm that the following breaks with numpy + mkl? CODELCODEL. If you get a segfault with the OSX process crash report, please report the stack trace here. I close this issue as the original bug has now been fixed by the new numpy wheel package on PyPI. kevindavenport could you please open a new issue for if you can reproduce the crash with numpy MKL and the code snippet provided in my earlier comment? I am still getting this bug with the latest versions of everything on a mac. numpy + mkl breaks. mkl, not accelerate? I didn't realize that was a problem, too.

'extra link args': 'extra compile args': 'define macros': ogrisel can you remind me of the details with accelerate? AWNystrom you are using apple accelerate blas, which is known to not cooperate with multi processing. Did you install numpy via conda? If you are in an academic setting, you could get the conda accelerate package yes that is a different accelerate, which contains numpy linked against MKL. Or you could build a numpy yourself and link it against a different blas. I'm not sure if there are is a free conda numpy that for OS X that is not linked against accelerate. The problem is that multiprocessing does a fork without an exec. Many libraries like some versions of Accelerate vecLib, some versions of MKL, the OpenMP runtime of GCC, nvidia's cuda and probably many others, manage their own internal thread pool. Upon a syscall to fork, the thread pool state in the child process is corrupted: the thread pool things it has many threads while only the main thread state has been forked. It's possible to change the libraries to make them detect when a fork happens and reinitialize the thread pool in that case: we did that for OpenBLAS merged upstream in master since 0.9 and we contributed a LINKLINK not yet reviewed to GCC's OpenMP runtime. In the end the real culprit is Python's multiprocessing that does fork without exec to reduce the overhead of starting and using new Python process for parallel computing, it's kind of a hack. This is a violation of the POSIX standard and therefore organizations like Apple refuse to consider the lack of fork safety in Accelerate vecLib as a bug. In Python 3.4+ it's now possible to configure multiprocessing to use the 'forkserver' or 'spawn' start methods instead of the default 'fork' to manage the process pools. This should make it possible to not be subject to this issue anymore. We don't use it by default in joblib because it causes some overhead and would make the default behavior slightly different in Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+. Maybe we should change the default to 'forkserver' under POSIX to have this problem disappear for Python 3.4+ users. Thank you for the great explanation. Should we add this a short version of this to the FAQ? And open a dedicated fork savety issue to keep track? Thanks, Andreas. I have some latent memory of having to change numpy versions to get something to work and doing it via pip. Good idea, I am on it. In addition to documenting the problem in the scikit learn FAQ I went ahead and make joblib use the forkserver start method by default under POSIX system with Python 3.4 or later: joblib joblib 232. Feedback appreciated.
