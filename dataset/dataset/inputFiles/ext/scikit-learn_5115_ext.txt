I've been intermittently running into this issue in the subject with GridSearchCV over a year now, across python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 3 [CLS] [SEP] and 3 [CLS] [SEP] two jobs, several different mac osx platforms laptops, and many different versions of numpy and scikit learn I keep them updated pretty well [CLS] [SEP] I've tried all of these suggestions and none of them always work: LINKLINK Setting multiprocessing start method to 'forkserver'. LINKLINK Having issues ONLY when custom scoring functions are passed I've absolutely had this problem where the same GridSearchCV calls with n jobs [CLS] [SEP] 1 freeze with a custom scorer but do just fine without one. LINKLINK Setting environment variables from MKL thread counts I have tried this when running a numpy sklearn built against mkl from an Anaconda distribution. Scaling inputs and making sure there are no errors with n jobs 1 I'm completely sure that the things I'm trying to do on multiple threads run correctly on one thread, and in a small amount of time. It's a very frustrating problem that always seems to pop back up right when I'm confident it's gone, and the ONLY workaround that works 100 of the time for me is going to the source for GridSearchCV in whatever sklearn distribution I'm on an manually changing the backend set in the call to Paralell to 'threading' instead of multiprocessing [CLS] [SEP] I haven't benchmarked the difference between that hack and setting n jobs 1, but would there be any reason to expect any gains with the threading backend over no parallelization at all [CLS] [SEP] Certainly, it wouldn't be as good as multiprocessing but at least it's more stable [CLS] [SEP] btw the most recent versions I've had the same problem on are: Mac OS 10 [CLS] [SEP] Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 3: Continuum Analytics, Inc [CLS] [SEP] scikit learn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 16 [CLS] [SEP] scipy 0 [CLS] [SEP] 16 [CLS] [SEP] numpy 1 [CLS] [SEP] pandas 0 [CLS] [SEP] 16 [CLS] [SEP] joblib 0 [CLS] [SEP] 4. Do you have problems consistently on that platform [CLS] [SEP] In terms of multithreading: there are some estimators for which multithreading will likely give substantial gains, those where most of the work are done in numpy or Cython operations with no GIL [CLS] [SEP] Really, I don't think this has been evaluated much; CODESCODES is quite a recent thing [CLS] [SEP] The real question is: what more can we do to identify what the problem is [CLS] [SEP] For a start, what base estimators have you considered [CLS] [SEP] jnothman By platform do you OSX 10 [CLS] [SEP] 5 [CLS] [SEP] If so, then yea it's not the first time I've had that problem [CLS] [SEP] One possibly major detail I omitted before though was that I'm always using IPython notebooks when I have problems [CLS] [SEP] I've got a kernel for a notebook loaded right now where if I add a scoring argument with n jobs [CLS] [SEP] 1 then GridSearchCV hangs forever but if I remove that argument, all is fine [CLS] [SEP] Even if the scoring function I give does nothing but return a constant float value, it still freezes but does exactly what you would expect with n jobs 1 [CLS] [SEP] Re: threading that's good to hear, so maybe that option for GridSearchCV would actually make sense then [CLS] [SEP] As far as what estimators I have problems with goes I'm not sure I can narrow it down much [CLS] [SEP] I normally try as many of them as I can manage though to get some useful information for you here, I just verified that I could reproduce the conditions I mentioned above with any estimator and found that I could in all cases or at least I tried LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier, GBRT, and RF [CLS] [SEP] I'd love to do anything and everything I can to provide something more to go on though I'm not familiar with what context is generally most helpful for multithreading issues like this [CLS] [SEP] Have any suggestions for me [CLS] [SEP] Do you use numpy linked against the accelerate framework [CLS] [SEP] Nope, unless I'm missing something [CLS] [SEP] I thought that the numpy version installed changes when you do that or at the very least that the accelerate package would be present: research3 [CLS] [SEP] 4 eczech pip freeze grep numpy. numpy 1 [CLS] [SEP] research3 [CLS] [SEP] 4 eczech conda update accelerate. Error: package 'accelerate' is not installed in Users eczech anaconda envs research3 [CLS] [SEP] 4. Forgive my ignorance in not being able to answer that with 100 confidence, but I certainly didn't do anything intentionally to install it [CLS] [SEP] conda accelerate is not the same as apple accelerate: LINKLINK. LINKLINK. conda accelerate is MKL accelerated versions of packages, apple accelerate is their alternative to MKL [CLS] [SEP] can you give us CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] multiprocessing doesn't work with accelerate IIRC [CLS] [SEP] ping ogrisel. certainly: Yeah so that is a known issue that I can't find in the issue tracker [CLS] [SEP] Accelerate doesn't work with multiprocessing [CLS] [SEP] I'm a bit confused [CLS] [SEP] The threading backend only does something when the GIL is released, right [CLS] [SEP] Gotcha, do you know how I should go about rebuilding numpy then [CLS] [SEP] Should I just pip install it instead of using the conda package for it [CLS] [SEP] Or would I be better off to build from source and ensure those apple accelerate arguments aren't present [CLS] [SEP] Sounds like this is a bit of a nonstarter of an issue regardless [CLS] [SEP] Close away if it's just beating a dead horse [CLS] [SEP] if you can get the conda accelerate, it would work thumbs up. maybe we could try to bail in CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Ah great, continuum must have paid apple to do that haha [CLS] [SEP] Got any 0 suggestions [CLS] [SEP] And thanks for the insight either way [CLS] [SEP] Oh and also I know this has been asked before, but is the fact that I'm only having this issue on my current platform when using a custom scoring function something to go on [CLS] [SEP] For the life of me I can't see what could possibly be problematic about that given the grid search [CLS] [SEP] py source code, but might it having something to do with pickling of the custom function [CLS] [SEP] And somewhat unrelated to that, I just remembered that I also tried to work around this in the past by creating a modified version of GridSearchCV that uses the IPython parallel backend instead so assuming I revisited that solution, would it be worth sharing in some way [CLS] [SEP] That solution worked just fine but was a little bit of a pain to use because any custom classes and functions had to be available on the pythonpath rather than in the notebooks themselves but if there are no other better options, maybe that one has some legs [CLS] [SEP] You can link against atlas, but that will be slower accelerate, methinks [CLS] [SEP] Maybe there is a free MKL linked numpy out there for OS X [CLS] [SEP] There is one for windows [CLS] [SEP] I'm pretty sure this is entirely unrelated to using a custom scoring function [CLS] [SEP] Can you give self contained sniplets that break with a custom scoring function but not without [CLS] [SEP] Maybe the fact of the custom scoring function is relevant for example pickling issues or nested parallelism may be pertinent [CLS] [SEP] Could we see the code [CLS] [SEP] Or do you just mean a standard metric with CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Certainly, here's a relevant portion and it looks like things are fine with make scorer but not with a custom function: CODELCODEL. I'll work on a self contained version that involves some version of the data I'm using too but it will take longer [CLS] [SEP] In the meantime though, pickling of those custom functions sounds like a good lead I've tried it several times again to be sure and it hangs 100 of the time with a custom function and 0 of the time when using make scorer with some known, imported metric function [CLS] [SEP] And is that in main for example the top level script being interpreted or an. imported module [CLS] [SEP] On 15 August 2015 at 23:37, Eric Czech wrote: Oh, it's ipynb [CLS] [SEP] Hmmm interesting [CLS] [SEP] Yes, pickling could be an issue [CLS] [SEP] On 15 August 2015 at 23:51, Joel Nothman wrote: That's in a notebook. I'll try to import it from a module instead and see how that goes. Hmm what do you know, works fine when defined outside the notebook [CLS] [SEP] I have essentially the same code running in python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 7 I needed a lib that's older as well as this code in python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 4 and while I have the hanging issue in 2 [CLS] [SEP] 7 regardless of whether or not it's a custom function or something using make scorer, I think that solves all my problems in the newer version so I can just live with workarounds in the old one [CLS] [SEP] Anything else I can do to track down why pickling functions defined in a notebook might be a problem [CLS] [SEP] Well, we'd like to understand: is pickling and unpickling generally a problem for locally defined functions on that platform, or are we hitting a particular snag [CLS] [SEP] why, if pickling is a problem, is it hanging rather than raising an exception [CLS] [SEP] Could you please try monkey patching or similar, to see if replacing the CODESCODES check LINKLINK with CODESCODES results in an error [CLS] [SEP] To explain, this is a safety check to ensure pickleability before running multiprocessing [CLS] [SEP] ogrisel might be interested in this [CLS] [SEP] From what I saw on windows, notebooks have weird interactions with multiprocessing [CLS] [SEP] Have you tried just pickling and unpickling the function defined in the same notebook [CLS] [SEP] Today i accidentally have seen this LINKLINK, isn't it related [CLS] [SEP] Maybe you should just upgrade to python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 4 or newer [CLS] [SEP] Sorry went on a long vacation [CLS] [SEP] To answer your questions though: re jnothman: I put CODESCODES in parallel [CLS] [SEP] py and a print statement after it to make sure it was executing cleanly, and there were no problems there [CLS] [SEP] To be clear, GridSearchCV [CLS] [SEP] fit called from the notebook still got stuck just as before with no change except for the print statement I added showing up 16 times with n jobs thumbs down [CLS] [SEP] re amueller: If I'm understanding you correctly, then I ran something like this in the notebook with no issues: I haven't read the above conversation but I'd like to note that this minimal test fails under the Python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 6 build of travis but passed under a similar configuration in my PC [CLS] [SEP] suggesting it fails when CODESCODES is set under a single core machine for old python joblib scipy versions [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. thumbs up for having this issue, happy to provide details if it would help. eric czech If you are under Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 4 or 3 [CLS] [SEP] please try to set the following environment variable and then restart your python program: CODELCODEL. as explained in the LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] The forkserver is mode is not enabled by default as it breaks interactively defined functions [CLS] [SEP] Have the same issue on both OS X 10 [CLS] [SEP] 11 [CLS] [SEP] 4 and Ubuntu 14 [CLS] [SEP] 04 with the latest software installed [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. Actually, this code doesn't freeze only if CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] This should now work by default on python 3 and be a wontfix on python 2, right ogrisel [CLS] [SEP] Should we close [CLS] [SEP] If it hangs silently on Python 2 without throwing any warning or error n jobs 1 not supported on Python 2, that's not acceptable; can we throw an error [CLS] [SEP] amueller on Python 3 you can follow LINKLINK to work around the problem, for example it won't work by default even on Python Not sure whether we should close though because the original OP seemed to say that setting the joblib start method to forkserver did not always work [CLS] [SEP] BTW the xgboost one is a known one, see LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] Edit: The change below might not actually fix things [CLS] [SEP] There was an unrelated change I made as well to how I was handling multiprocessing with Pathos that might have been my real fix [CLS] [SEP] Quick Fix: CODESCODES. Explanation: I'd been running into this issue as well, most acutely in the test suite for LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] The first 2 [CLS] [SEP] times I ran GridSearchCV, it was fine, but then subsequent runs would hang without erroring [CLS] [SEP] I just set CODESCODES inside each of my tests, to ensure reproducibility while still giving myself the flexibility to re order the tests over time without messing with the randomness [CLS] [SEP] As soon as I did that, all the tests that hung on the GSCV error started working again [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. hope this helps with the debugging [CLS] [SEP] Dev environment: Mac OS X Sierra. Python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 7. Up to date versions of libraries [CLS] [SEP] ClimbsRocks well it's probably some error in your estimators [CLS] [SEP] Let us know if you have a reproducible example thumbs up amueller: good call [CLS] [SEP] I rushed off to cut a branch for you guys to reproduce this, but everything ran correctly this time [CLS] [SEP] I think it was probably an issue using GSCV's parallelization, when I'm also using Pathos's parallelization in other parts of the program [CLS] [SEP] That's the only other related thing I've changed in the past week or so [CLS] [SEP] I've since refactored to more thoroughly close and open their multiprocessing pool [CLS] [SEP] What makes me thing it wasn't just a bug in one of the estimators is that when building the test suite, each of the tests ran and passed individually [CLS] [SEP] It was only when I ran multiple tests in the same pass that all depended on GSCV that it started hanging [CLS] [SEP] Edited earlier comment to note this uncertainty [CLS] [SEP] if you combine joblib with any other parallelization, it's very likely that it'll crash and you shouldn't try that [CLS] [SEP] Sorry to up this thread but I also encounter this problem [CLS] [SEP] I created a Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 5 kernel and defined job lib start method to forkserver but I still have the problem [CLS] [SEP] In fact it doesn't even work with n jobs I see it computes except for the last parameter [CLS] [SEP] Is there any news [CLS] [SEP] This is weird and very likely not related to this issue then which is about CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] The best way to get good feedback would be to open a separate issue with a stand alone snippet reproducing the problem [CLS] [SEP] I am pretty sure I am coming across this issue myself [CLS] [SEP] After trying many combinations, everything I do with n jobs 1 simply freezes after a few folds [CLS] [SEP] I am on an Ubuntu Linux Laptop with sklearn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 19 [CLS] [SEP] so this is a different configuration from others I have read around [CLS] [SEP] Here is the offending code: CODELCODEL. One of the interesting things is that when I import xgboost, I get a deprecation warning on GridSearchCV as if it was not importing from model selection [CLS] [SEP] However, I am on xgboost 0 [CLS] [SEP] 62 and in looking at their repository it looks like they are importing the correct GridSearchCV [CLS] [SEP] To be clear, the deprecation warning is not the issue that concerns me but rather the one at hand: the execution freezing with n jobs 1 [CLS] [SEP] Just pointing out in case it could help [CLS] [SEP] could you provide data to help replicate the issue [CLS] [SEP] wrote: Sure, you can download the exact files I am using from: LINKLINK. LINKLINK. HTTP404Sorry, there was a mistake in the first link, it should now be fixed [CLS] [SEP] The 2nd should also be ok, I just checked [CLS] [SEP] Known issue with xgboost, see LINKLINK for example [CLS] [SEP] FYI, the LINKLINK backend in joblib will get rid of this kind of problems but this will be only available in scikit learn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 20 [CLS] [SEP] Is this still a bug [CLS] [SEP] I'm having same problem with defaults n jobs 1 as well as with pre dispatch 1, using a CODESCODES, with 80 combinations of parameters and ShuffleSplit CV n 20 [CLS] [SEP] It also hangs for a Pipeline CODESCODES followed by CODESCODES, both under the latest release as well as devel version [CLS] [SEP] Let me know if you guys found a workaround, or other model selection methods that work reliably [CLS] [SEP] Thinking of giving CODESCODES a try [CLS] [SEP] Do you mean n jobs 1 or is it a typo [CLS] [SEP] This issue is about n jobs [CLS] [SEP] The best way to get quality feed back is to provide a way to reproduce the problem [CLS] [SEP] Please open a separate issue in this case if the problem you are seeing is indeed with n jobs 1 [CLS] [SEP] I wrote what I meant, which is multithreading enabled”. n jobs [CLS] [SEP] 1 as in ‘not equal to 1’ [CLS] [SEP] Equivalently, n jobs For example, n jobs 4. Are you saying you can’t repro the freeze for n jobs 4 [CLS] [SEP] If so, I will provide testcase within a month I’m changing to a new machine [CLS] [SEP] Loïc Estève wrote: Do you mean n jobs 1 or is it a typo [CLS] [SEP] This issue is about n jobs [CLS] [SEP] The best way to get quality feed back is to provide a way to reproduce the problem [CLS] [SEP] Please open a separate issue in this case if the problem you are seeing is indeed with n jobs 1 [CLS] [SEP] You are receiving this because you were mentioned [CLS] [SEP] Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread [CLS] [SEP] smcinerney are you raamana [CLS] [SEP] I think lesteve replied to raamana who wrote CODESCODES n jobs 1 CODESCODES, which seems to be unrelated to this issue [CLS] [SEP] Oh sorry, no I’m not raamana [CLS] [SEP] Yes raamana’s issue is different but probably due to the same code. Andreas Mueller wrote: smcinerney are you raamana [CLS] [SEP] I think lesteve replied to raamana who wrote n jobs 1, which seems to be unrelated to this issue [CLS] [SEP] You are receiving this because you were mentioned [CLS] [SEP] Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread [CLS] [SEP] My bad, I didn't mean to mix stuff up [CLS] [SEP] I will open another issue with minimal code to reproduce it, but isn't GridSearchCV hanging even with default n jobs 1 is a bigger concern given it is default and is supposed to work than n jobs. raamana yes it's a bigger concern but it's also unlikely to be caused by a related issue [CLS] [SEP] eric czech jnothman. So if you decide to use backend 'threading' [CLS] [SEP] One easy method without changing the sklearn code would be to use parallel backend context manager and not change in the GSV's fit method [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. PS: I am not sure if threading works for all estimators [CLS] [SEP] But I was having the same issue with my estimator with GSV njob 1 and using this works as expected for me without changing the library [CLS] [SEP] System tried on: MAC OS: 10 [CLS] [SEP] 12 [CLS] [SEP] 6. Python: 3 [CLS] [SEP] 6. numpy 1 [CLS] [SEP] 13 [CLS] [SEP] 3. pandas 0 [CLS] [SEP] 21 [CLS] [SEP] 0. scikit learn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 19 [CLS] [SEP] 1. Hmm [CLS] [SEP] There can be some concurrency issues with using threading backend in. grid search, for instance the bug in 10329 creates race conditions [CLS] [SEP] Case: Using backend as threading and using Estimator which extends BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin [CLS] [SEP] I am not sure where the race condition is caused [CLS] [SEP] Can you please elaborate [CLS] [SEP] As per my understanding and experiments, I didn't observe any race condition [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. fit and score is called on the clone base estimator [CLS] [SEP] This does a deep copy and have a copy of it's own data [CLS] [SEP] out is the output of the fit and score method [CLS] [SEP] So after this, all the threads have completed executing fit method of the estimator and reported the results [CLS] [SEP] The results is what you get from GCV clf [CLS] [SEP] cv results. Can you please explain in this specific case why would it cause a race condition [CLS] [SEP] The race condition occurs if you are setting nested parameters, for example when. one param changed is an estimator and another is a parameter of that. estimator [CLS] [SEP] I'm experiencing the same issue using CODESCODES in combination with CODESCODES and CODESCODES under Win 7 with recent versions: CODELCODEL. mansenfranzen thanks for posting your versions and platform [CLS] [SEP] The best chance to get some good quality feed back is to provide a stand alone snippet to reproduce the problem [CLS] [SEP] Please read LINKLINK for more details [CLS] [SEP] Experiencing the same problem under Win7 with any custom preprocessing steps [CLS] [SEP] Toolchain: Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] NumPy 1 [CLS] [SEP] 13 [CLS] [SEP] 1 [CLS] [SEP] 14 [CLS] [SEP] 2 under both.

Oh, interesting [CLS] [SEP] Out of plain laziness I placed the whole script under CODESCODES and got the results from the previous comment [CLS] [SEP] Now I placed only CODESCODES, and it executed successfully [CLS] [SEP] Maybe it is the cause in Jupyter [CLS] [SEP] Anyway, I do not know if the behavour in the previous comment is valid and caused by the improper use of CODESCODES, or if it is SkLearn's fault [CLS] [SEP] it sounds like it's not a problem with our library, but about the execution. context for multiprocessing in windows [CLS] [SEP] That's nasty [CLS] [SEP] And indeed, I could not reproduce any of the problems under Ubuntu with the same versions of everything [CLS] [SEP] Thanks for help [CLS] [SEP] Can confirm this bug is alive and well [CLS] [SEP] Running on Windows 10 in a jupyter notebook, Python3, Sklearn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 19 [CLS] [SEP] 1Same problem on Linux Mint Ubuntu 16 [CLS] [SEP] 10 Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 5. Everything gets stuck at first Epoch on each core, and CPUs are iddleing, so no work is being done [CLS] [SEP] MrLobs that sounds like a pickling error, right [CLS] [SEP] put CustomTransformer in a separate python file [CLS] [SEP] Chrisjw42 avatsaev without more context we can't really do much [CLS] [SEP] avatsaev sounds like you might be using tensorflow [CLS] [SEP] amueller yes it's tensorflow avatsaev that's still not really enough information [CLS] [SEP] Do you have a minimum example to reproduce [CLS] [SEP] what blas are you using, are you using GPU, what version of scikit learn are you using [CLS] [SEP] Ok it turns out it's because I'm using TF GPU so setting n jobs to 1 doesn't really work, which is normal because I only have one GPU lolyeah you shouldn't really use n jobs with TF either way [CLS] [SEP] why not [CLS] [SEP] amueller, yes, putting custom transformers into a separate file solves itWould it be possible for n jobs [CLS] [SEP] 1 to throw an error or a warning at least in the environments it's going to hang in [CLS] [SEP] I just encountered this problem in jupyter notebooks, and if I was a more beginner user like the rest of my class, I would have never figured out why gridsearchcv kept hanging, in fact, our teacher even advised us to use n jobs thumbs down [CLS] [SEP] If the problem here is known, could the package keras, or sklearn, whichever warn that it will occur and prevent the hang [CLS] [SEP] I don't think that anyone knows what environment this is going to hang in [CLS] [SEP] I don't believe that anyone has managed to reproduce this bug in a reliable way [CLS] [SEP] but we are working towards improving our multiprocessing infrastructure [CLS] [SEP] it's unclear to me whether that will solve all such issues [CLS] [SEP] jnothman thumbs up. That is great to hear [CLS] [SEP] I'm not sure why this is tagged 0 [CLS] [SEP] 21 [CLS] [SEP] This is solved in 0 [CLS] [SEP] 20 in most instances [CLS] [SEP] I think we should close this and have people open new issues [CLS] [SEP] This one is too long and unspecific [CLS] [SEP] I have just encountered the same on AWS Ubuntu with jupyter [CLS] [SEP] Using parallel backend seems to work [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL morienor if you can reproduce this issue with scikit learn 0 [CLS] [SEP] 20 [CLS] [SEP] please open a new issue with all the necessary details for someone else to be able to reproduced the problem the full script with import statements on a fake random dataset along with all the version numbers for python, scikit learn, numpy, scipy and the operating system [CLS] [SEP] That's works for me [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] jmq19950824 morienor yeah but there's no point in using CODESCODES backend due to GIL [CLS] [SEP] genius works for me to.
