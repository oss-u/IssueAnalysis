WebSocket connection to wss: xxxxx failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400maybe somehow corporate firewall blocks websocket connections used by kernelsYeah, that does sound like there's some sort of corporate firewall or proxy server which doesn't like websocket connections [CLS] [SEP] I'm surprised it affects https traffic as well, though [CLS] [SEP] S CODELCODEL Hey, I had the same issue with my workplace having locked down non standard ports to external servers, such as my jupyter server [CLS] [SEP] I came across LINKLINK which solved it in case you're still having trouble [CLS] [SEP] I just needed to add some additional location configuration to my nginx [CLS] [SEP] conf file [CLS] [SEP] Hope this helps [CLS] [SEP] tyyzqmf solution worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Thank you [CLS] [SEP] jonasdebeukelaer I'm on a Google Cloud Instance running Ubuntu 18 [CLS] [SEP] 04 [CLS] [SEP] What do I have to do exactly [CLS] [SEP] thanks tyyzqmf, that's is the solution. CODELCODEL Downgrading tornado to 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3 fixed my problem [CLS] [SEP] with pip CODESCODES. with conda CODESCODES ThejanW thank you very much [CLS] [SEP] It worked [CLS] [SEP] Thank you so much Sir [CLS] [SEP] 1Thanks, ThejanW [CLS] [SEP] Tornado had a release 6 [CLS] [SEP] 0 on Mar 1, which triggered this problem recently, see: LINKLINK. Note: the previous tornado release was 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1thanks tvalentyn and ThejanW [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES is causing issues with jupyter notebook [CLS] [SEP] Downgradring to CODESCODES works [CLS] [SEP] Same here [CLS] [SEP] I had to downgrade to CODESCODES like ThejanW suggested for the Kernel to work [CLS] [SEP] Sounds like an issue that Jupyter needs to investigate [CLS] [SEP] Same here [CLS] [SEP] Fixed using: CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] If you have a CODESCODES file look for references to that library [CLS] [SEP] In my case there was a line reading CODESCODES that I changed to CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] I'm using python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 2 [CLS] [SEP] I m using python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 6 in virtualenv [CLS] [SEP] fixed it by CODESCODES. Great find [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] Yes, pip install tornado tornado 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3 worked for me too [CLS] [SEP] Thank you for sharing ThejanW [CLS] [SEP] Awesome！Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] Tornado solved my problem, i hadn't install it from the beginning and once i've installed it worked like a charm. Downgrading Tornado from 6 [CLS] [SEP] 1 to 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 fixed this for me as well, on macOS with Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 7 installed via CODESCODES and Jupyter 4 [CLS] [SEP] 0 installed via CODESCODES: pip3 install tornado 5 [CLS] [SEP] Collecting tornado 5 [CLS] [SEP] Downloading LINKLINK 516kB.

Same here, downgrading to tornado 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 does the trick [CLS] [SEP] Same here downgrading tornado 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 work as temporarily fix [CLS] [SEP] Thanks i started to become crazy about this bug. ThejanW it works for me, thanks [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, it works [CLS] [SEP] WOW [CLS] [SEP] I see also same the issue [CLS] [SEP] i install jupyter and run jupyter notebook, it can not work [CLS] [SEP] i watch tornado version use pip show tornado, find tornado version is 6 [CLS] [SEP] 1 [CLS] [SEP] then, i use pip install tornado 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3 and run jupyter notebook, it can work [CLS] [SEP] the way is usefully [CLS] [SEP] thanksUpgrading to notebook version LINKLINK will provide compatibility with Tornado 6 [CLS] [SEP] x [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. This fixed my issue, Thank you [CLS] [SEP] This worked for me too. CODELCODEL. But I wonder if anyone could recap why this actually solves this [CLS] [SEP] The issue has already been fixed, notebook 5 [CLS] [SEP] 5 is now compatible with tornado 6 [CLS] [SEP] xWorked for me as well [CLS] [SEP] Spent half the afternoon searching for this fix [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] I use jupyter in the GCP instance ubuntu [CLS] [SEP] It was perfectly working till yesterday with tornado 6 [CLS] [SEP] 2 [CLS] [SEP] Suddenly today morning this error started showing up and I'm puzzled with it [CLS] [SEP] I have tried downgrading the tornado versions with all you accepted solutions above but non works for me [CLS] [SEP] Any help on this would be great [CLS] [SEP] Thanks. Arav. Hi. I have tried all the versions of the tornado, it doesn't solve the issue [CLS] [SEP] I started with python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 6 and tried till python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 3 with all the combinations of tornado versions [CLS] [SEP] Its still giving the same problem [CLS] [SEP] As I said I using jupyter in a GCP instance ubuntu [CLS] [SEP] The Jupyter notebook was perfectly work till last week and suddenly this happend [CLS] [SEP] I'm not sure what the problem is [CLS] [SEP] I have tried all the solutions you guys have mentioned here [CLS] [SEP] Any help on this is much apreciated [CLS] [SEP] Thanks. Arav. Can you give the error messages [CLS] [SEP] The below is the error message. When I open the jupyter notebook, the connection is successful and the kernel starts but when I open a python ipynb file, this is the error I'm getting [CLS] [SEP] Hope I was clear in explaining [CLS] [SEP] In the command prompt, I don't any error message, 302 GET 165 [CLS] [SEP] 225 [CLS] [SEP] 80 [CLS] [SEP] 69 0 [CLS] [SEP] 64ms. 302 GET tree [CLS] [SEP] 165 [CLS] [SEP] 225 [CLS] [SEP] 80 [CLS] [SEP] 69 0 [CLS] [SEP] 79ms. 302 POST login [CLS] [SEP] next 2Ftree 3F 165 [CLS] [SEP] 225 [CLS] [SEP] 80 [CLS] [SEP] 69 1 [CLS] [SEP] 56ms.

AravI'm getting a smiliar error [CLS] [SEP] 4630. It has something to do with the websocket connection [CLS] [SEP] I'm not sure how to resolve this issue with the websocket [CLS] [SEP] The linked issue can give you more details on the issue [CLS] [SEP] Cheers. Aravthank you, ThejanW from my experience, Jupyter should be configured with ssl and start with https, then you will not see this problem [CLS] [SEP] thanx a lot [CLS] [SEP] downgrading tornado solved my problem. Hi, everyone [CLS] [SEP] I'm trying to downgrade to 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 through conda, but it failed [CLS] [SEP] Can anyone please give some advice [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. I'm trying to access Jupyter Notebook in a remote server [CLS] [SEP] I installed using LINKLINK and and downgrade to tornado 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3, but still getting the same error [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. Our issue was that our proxy public ELB in AWS was listening on HTTP instead of TCP, and the kernel endpoint uses web sockets which goes over TCP. Where can I set this [CLS] [SEP] My case is IE and firefox works well, but Chrome developer tool shows me on the Websocket response: Connection closed before receiving a handshake responseSolution address: LINKLINK. Here's a solution for me [CLS] [SEP] I have a cloud server and my own domain name [CLS] [SEP] When I try to access my notenook on my Centos server by using my domain name, some services cannot start like python [CLS] [SEP] Then I found that the jupyter notebook need to use websocket to connect the server, which means I need to add some configs to my nginx like this: CODELCODEL. It works [CLS] [SEP] thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] worked for me toopip uninstall tornado. pip install tornado 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3 LINKLINK. i am getting this error. I resolved with this. CODELCODEL I believe I'm experiencing the same problem still with: ipykernel 5 [CLS] [SEP] 4. jupyter client 6 [CLS] [SEP] 0. jupyter core 4 [CLS] [SEP] 3. jupyter telemetry 0 [CLS] [SEP] 5. jupyterhub 1 [CLS] [SEP] 0. notebook 6 [CLS] [SEP] 3. tornado 6 [CLS] [SEP] 4. I have Apache proxy set up after this: LINKLINK. Kernel does NOT connect when JHub is access via Apache's Proxy [CLS] [SEP] Downgrading 'tornado' does not help [CLS] [SEP] Any help greatly appreciated [CLS] [SEP] thanks, L [CLS] [SEP] tyyzqmf You did me a great favor [CLS] [SEP] 感谢大神！！！. In my case, I am the same as you [CLS] [SEP] After enable the LB websocket choice, then it fixed I am quite new to Python [CLS] [SEP] My Jupyter Notebook won's show any output [CLS] [SEP] What could be the reason [CLS] [SEP] And how do I fix it [CLS] [SEP]
