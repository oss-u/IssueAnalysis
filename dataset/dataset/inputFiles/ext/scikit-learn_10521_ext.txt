Based on some discussions we are having here and issues that are opened, we are having some doubts that CODESCODES LINKLINK was the good choice of name and since it is not released yet we have some room for change [CLS] [SEP] So summary of how it is now: The class name CODESCODES says what type of data it accepts categorical data. The keyword argument CODESCODES specifies how to encode those data. Currently we already have CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] But what to do in the following cases: We want to add more encoding options eg binary encoding, mean target encoding, unary encoding, Do we keep adding those as new values for the CODESCODES kwarg in the one big CODESCODES class [CLS] [SEP] We want to add an option specific to one of the encodings eg for 'onehot' encoding to drop the first redundant column, or for 'ordinal' encoding base the order of the categories on the frequency, The problem here is that we then need to add additional keyword arguments to CODESCODES that are or are not active depending on what you passed for CODESCODES kwarg, which is not the nicest API design [CLS] [SEP] For that last problem, we already had this with the CODESCODES option, which was only relevant for 'onehot' and not for 'ordinal', and which we solved with having both 'onehot' and 'onehot dense' encoding options and not a CODESCODES keyword [CLS] [SEP] But such an approach also does not scale [CLS] [SEP] Related to this, there is a PR to add a CODESCODES LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] There was a related discussion on the naming in that PR, as currently the name says how it encodes, not what type of data it gets in the current design, it accepts already encoded integers, not actual categorical data [CLS] [SEP] In that regard, to be consistent with CategoricalEncoder, it might better be named OrdinalEncoder because it needs ordinal data as input [CLS] [SEP] What are the options forward:1 Keep things as we have it now in master, and be be OK with adding some new options to the single class an important question which is hard to answer now, is how much new features we will want to add in the future [CLS] [SEP] 2 Switch the naming scheme and have a bunch of 'categorical encoders' where the name says how it encodes OnehotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, and later maybe BinaryEncoder, UnaryEncoder, So it is a bit a trade off of potential build up of number of classes vs number of keyword arguments in a single class [CLS] [SEP] One problem with the second approach and one of the reasons we went with CODESCODES in the first place, even before we added the multiple encoding options, is that there is already a CODESCODES, which has a different API than the CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] And, there is not really a good other name we could use for the encoder that does one hot encoding [CLS] [SEP] However, I think that, with some temporary ugly hacks, we could reuse the name, if we are OK with deprecating the current attributes and I think we agree it are not the most useful attributes [CLS] [SEP] The idea would be that if you fit the class with string data, you get the new behaviour, and if you fit the class with integer data, you get a deprecation warning indicating the default behaviour will change and indicating which keyword to specify to get rid of the warning [CLS] [SEP] cc jnothman amueller GaelVaroquaux rth Thanks for the summary jorisvandenbossche [CLS] [SEP] I think I am in favor of option 2: reuse CODESCODES class, deprecate the weird attributes and add a constructor parameter to select the behavior with a future warning that says that the default behavior will change but makes it easy to silence that warning just by passing a value for that option [CLS] [SEP] The idea of reverting CategoricalEncoder makes me quite sad, but I think. you're right that future users would be less mystified by option My main. concern is that we have tried implementing this as a change to OHE for a. long time and it never flew [CLS] [SEP] Perhaps it would be good to attempt the. modifications to the OneHotEncoder docstring according to that proposed. change, so we can see if it looks sane [CLS] [SEP] thumbs up to what Joel said.⁣Sent from my phone [CLS] [SEP] Please forgive typos and briefness [CLS] [SEP] ​. To be clear, it would not be a revert, it would be a refactor rename that keeps all functionality [CLS] [SEP] But I also like the CategoricalEncoder name, that would indeed be sad [CLS] [SEP] That said, I will quickly try to do the changes to have an idea how possible it is to integrate this in OnehotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] OK, I opened a PR with a proof of concept: LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] It's not yet complete no deprecation warnings and new attributes are not yet calculated in old behaviour [CLS] [SEP] The main API question is about the format of the input data [CLS] [SEP] So as a recap, there are two different ways we currently process the categorical data:1 As actual, not yet encoded integer or string, categorical data how it is done in CODESCODES infer categories from the unique values in the training data.2 As integer, already encoded data how it is done in the current CODESCODES infer categories from the maximum value in the training data. The question is: do we find both cases worth supporting [CLS] [SEP] Thus, in the potentially merged OneHotEncoder, do we keep the ability to do both, or do we fully deprecate and then remove the ability to process ordinal input [CLS] [SEP] If want the ability to process both, we can add a boolean keyword to specify the input data type for now I use CODESCODES, but other ideas are CODESCODES, For the deprecation period, we have to support both anyway, and also have to introduce a keyword to choose the behaviour to be able to silence the warning and choose the new behaviour [CLS] [SEP] So in principle we could just keep the keyword afterwards [CLS] [SEP] Given that we want to handle both, an overview of how OneHotEncoder would work: for now CODESCODES, and we infer the default based on the data. if int like data handled before by OneHotEncoder CODESCODES is internally set to True and a deprecation warning is raised [CLS] [SEP] If the user wants to keep the current behaviour, it can manually specify it as CODESCODES to silence the warning [CLS] [SEP] if the input is not int like, we set CODESCODES internally to False and without warning use the new behaviour the current CategoricalEncoder behaviour. in the future we change the default of CODESCODES from None to False by default the new behaviour, also for int like data I'm still not sure what you're suggesting is the practical difference due to inferring categories from the max value [CLS] [SEP] jnothman I suppose you acknowledge there can be a difference in practice [CLS] [SEP] the output you get depending on the data you have. But whether this difference is important in practice, I don't know [CLS] [SEP] That's where I would like to see feedback [CLS] [SEP] Whether anybody actually wants this max value based method, or whether we are fine with in the future, after deprecation only having the unique values based method [CLS] [SEP] I think I personally would never need this max value based method, but the OneHotEncoder has been like that for many years for good reason or not [CLS] [SEP] Actually deprecating the max value based categorization would certainly make the implementation after deprecation simpler [CLS] [SEP] And if we choose for that route, I agree the option should rather be CODESCODES rather than CODESCODES CODESCODES. Remind me what the actual difference in output is, when n values 'auto', please [CLS] [SEP] I had thought the active features thing made them basically. identical, but I'm probably forgetting something [CLS] [SEP] Aha, that clarifies our misunderstanding: I misunderstood how the current OneHotEncoder is actually working [CLS] [SEP] Suppose you have one feature with values [CLS] [SEP] I thought the current OneHotEncoder would have categories while current CategoricalEncoder would have categories [CLS] [SEP] But you are right that the CODESCODES is also only, essentially making them the same with the default value of CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] So it is only the case where you pass an integer to CODESCODES like CODESCODES for categories in the above case to specify the number of categories that will actually be an API change deprecated removed [CLS] [SEP] And that will be easily be replacable by the user with CODESCODES. Sorry for the confusion [CLS] [SEP] In that light, I think we even don't need the CODESCODES option [CLS] [SEP] We can just translate CODESCODES to CODESCODES internally and raise a warning for that but need to check this with the actual tests [CLS] [SEP] The other difference is the handling of unseen categories [CLS] [SEP] With the current behaviour of the OneHotEncoder, if the unseen values are within the range 0, max, it will not raise an error even if CODESCODES the default [CLS] [SEP] But also that can be solved separately by in such a case raising a warning that the user should set CODESCODES manually to keep the existing behaviour [CLS] [SEP] The only feature we would loose is the distinction between unknown categories that are within the range 0, max by the current OneHotEncoder not regarded as 'unknown' and those that are bigger than that max, those are currently already regarded as unknown by the OneHotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] no, that is the sort of thing we have tried before and it's just too. finicky [CLS] [SEP] unless there is good reason to maintain current behaviour, we. should just have a legacy mode to slowly bring us to the future [CLS] [SEP] Can you clarify to which aspect this no refers [CLS] [SEP] To the fact that I think a CODESCODES is not needed [CLS] [SEP] yes, to the idea that you can just make something that is both backwards. compatible and what we want going forward. That was not what I tried to suggest [CLS] [SEP] I wanted to make clear that think it is possible to not have a CODESCODES keyword, not by having it magically both backwards compat and what we want in the future, but by deprecating the behaviour of the existing keywords [CLS] [SEP] So to be concrete: a non default value of CODESCODES can be deprecated and has to be replaced by CODESCODES specification [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES in case of integer data should be set explicitly by the user to choose either full ignoring or full erroring instead of current mix and otherwise deprecation warning is raised [CLS] [SEP] so if I do [CLS] [SEP] fit [CLS] [SEP] transform, for which values of n values, categories and handle umknown will that raise an error [CLS] [SEP] wrote: can we just make it so that during deprecation, categories must be set. explicitly, and legacy mode with warnings is otherwise in effect [CLS] [SEP] Is that. what you are suggesting [CLS] [SEP] Yes, it might be still missing case, but I think this is possible will check by actual coding it next week [CLS] [SEP] The different 'legacy' cases: n values 'auto' the default. handle unknown 'ignore' fine, no change in behaviour. handle unknown 'error' Problem, values in range are still ignored, values above range error. Possible solution: in fit, if the range is consecutive fine, no change in behaviour for all people that now combined LabelEncoder with it, which is a typical use case I think. if this is not the case: raise deprecation warning that they have to set categories explicitly to keep this behaviour and internally use legacy mode. n values value. this can be translated to categories internally, and raise deprecation warning that user should do that themselves in the future. in this case CODESCODES work as expected. The deprecation warning in case of CODESCODES will only be raise in CODESCODES and not upon construction which is not really ideal, but it is only in fit that we know that the user is passing it numeric data and not string data [CLS] [SEP] we don't usually raise warnings until fit in any case so don't worry about. that [CLS] [SEP] that strategy sounds mostly good [CLS] [SEP] I'm not actually sure if we should be sniffing for strings in the data, though [CLS] [SEP] You basically want it to be: legacy mode is active if categories is. not set and if the data is all integers [CLS] [SEP] One question: if categories and n values parameters are their default, do. we publish categories [CLS] [SEP] If n values is set explicitly, do we publish. categories [CLS] [SEP] wrote: Yes indeed in practice it will more or less be the same. I personally would already as much as possible provide the attributes of the new interface, even in legacy mode [CLS] [SEP] So in both case I would calculate CODESCODES even if it would be a bit more work. So I tried to put the above logic in code will push some updates to the PR, and I have one more question for the case of integer data when CODESCODES or CODESCODES is not set typical case for 'legacy mode' [CLS] [SEP] The problem lies in the fact that if the inferred categories are simply a consecutive range 0, 1, 2, 3, max, there is no difference between the new and old legacy behaviour, and we don't necessarily need to raise a deprecation warning [CLS] [SEP] Some possibilities to do in this specific case:1 Detect this case that the inferred categories are a consecutive range, and in that case don't raise a warning [CLS] [SEP] This is possible to detect with a little bit of extra code complexity as we are already in fit anyhow. I think this will be a common case when using OneHotEncoder with integer data, and a case where the user actually does not need to worry about our refactoring, so it would be nice to not bother him her with a warning.2 Always raise a warning, and indicate in the warning message what to do if you are in such a case in addition to an explanation what to do if you don't have a consecutive range: If they know they have only consecutive ranges as categories, they want to ignore the warning, so we can add to the warning message an explanation how to do this add a code sample with filterwarnings they can copy paste. A potential advantage of this is that we can also add to the warning message that if they used the LabelEncoder to create the integers, they can now directly use OneHotEncoder I think this currently is a typical usage pattern [CLS] [SEP] That way, the warning will also go away.3 Always raise a warning but provide a keyword to silence it eg CODESCODES. If we find the advice to use a CODESCODES statement see point 2 above too cumbersome, we could also add a keyword to obtain the same result. Disadvantage of this is introducing a keyword that will not be needed anymore in a few releases when the deprecations are cleaned up [CLS] [SEP] I am personally in favor of option 1 or Using the LabelEncoder before OneHotEncoder seems to be a typical pattern from a quick github search, and in those case you always have consecutive ranges, and there will never be a change in behaviour with the new implementation, so we shouldn't warn for it [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand, if we warn we can point them to the fact that if they used LabelEncoder, they no longer need to do it [CLS] [SEP] Which would be nice to actually give this advice explicitly [CLS] [SEP] The question is how frequently users have such consecutive integers as categories without having used LabelEncoder as the previous step [CLS] [SEP] Hmm, one case I forgot is when you have integer inferred categories that are not consecutive let's say, but you want the new behaviour and not legacy behaviour so in that case you cannot just ignore the warning, as that would handle unseen values differently in the transform step, for example values in between the range eg 2 will not raise an error [CLS] [SEP] Sorry for all the long text, but it's quite complex thumbs up We're only talking about the case where n values is unset, right [CLS] [SEP] I'm fine with 1 [CLS] [SEP] and it would not be any more expensive, since auto. already needs to examine the set of labels [CLS] [SEP] I could also accept, for. simplicity, a variant of that was just OneHotEncoder running in legacy. mode [CLS] [SEP] Set categories 'auto' for slightly different behaviour without a. warning [CLS] [SEP] Yes the other case easily be translated in its equivalent CODESCODES value, with a nice deprecation warning, and without different in new and legacy behaviour. Ah, that sounds like a good idea [CLS] [SEP] irregardless of whether detecting the consecutive categories case or not [CLS] [SEP] So we set in the code the default of CODESCODES to None without changing the semantics of its default, so we know if the user set it explicitly, and in that way it is a nice way to indicate CODESCODES without needing that extra keyword [CLS] [SEP] Yes, but only if we want to warn every time someone uses it without passing. categories [CLS] [SEP] It's the cheap implementation approach, but it might be. unnecessarily verbose for the users, which is why I would prefer 1 if it. can be done simply [CLS] [SEP] What fresh hell is this thumbs down OR we could name the new one CODESCODES DummyEncoder CODESCODES thumbs up though that is a bit conflicting with the DummyClassifier amueller Don't read all of the above [CLS] [SEP] I was just planning to make a nice summary for new readers of the issue [CLS] [SEP] The above discussion is overly complicated also because I was still not fully understanding the current complex behaviour of OneHotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] I think GaelVaroquaux was against that because one hot is known to be this in more fields and we already use 'Dummy' for other things in scikit learn [CLS] [SEP] Redoing this for consistency in naming is not worth it imho [CLS] [SEP] We are not consistent in naming anywhere [CLS] [SEP] Could you summarize the discussions that lead to this [CLS] [SEP] I think dummy is what statisticians use and it's what pandas uses [CLS] [SEP] The top post is still accurate and worth a read, and it summarizes the reasoning for not keeping CategoricalEncoder which does not mean that we need to use OneHotEncoder instead of eg DummyEncoder, that's a separate question I read the top post [CLS] [SEP] That's what I referred to when I said redoing this for consistency is not worth it [CLS] [SEP] Can you explain that [CLS] [SEP] With consistency, are you pointing to the naming scheme of what it accepts vs what it does [CLS] [SEP] If so, that was only a minor reason [CLS] [SEP] For me it is mainly a question of scalability in adding more features to a single class [CLS] [SEP] We had the issue about how to handle missing values LINKLINK, and for this you could want different behaviour for ordinal and one hot encoding or not all options are valid for both, We also already have the existing CODESCODES which is only relevant for one hot encoding and not for ordinal [CLS] [SEP] And there was LINKLINK about feature weighting for onehot encoding, but also not relevant for ordinal this issue in the end was not a problem, as you can do the weighting with the ColumnTransformer transformer weights argument [CLS] [SEP] And we also have the feature request to add something like CODESCODES for one hot, which is again not relevant for ordinal encoding [CLS] [SEP] I don't see how the proposed change would help with the missing values that much [CLS] [SEP] And having incompatible options is something that happens often in scikit learn [CLS] [SEP] Not ideal, but also not a big deal imho [CLS] [SEP] It does not help as such, but it makes it less complex to have specific options specifically tailored to the different encoding types [CLS] [SEP] Currently it is certainly still OK, there are not too many incompatible options but also partly because I moved CODESCODES into the CODESCODES option [CLS] [SEP] But the question is to what extent we want to expand the encoding functionality in scikit learn in the future [CLS] [SEP] Which is of course a difficult question to answer now [CLS] [SEP] We already have a PR for 'unary encoding' [CLS] [SEP] Shouldn't this be rather added to CategoricalEncoder instead of adding a new class UnaryEncoder [CLS] [SEP] And what if someone wants to add a 'binary encoding' [CLS] [SEP] Or a ' mean target encoder' [CLS] [SEP] The mean target encoder is CODESCODES CountTransformer CODESCODES, there's a PR for that thumbs up Do you have a link for that [CLS] [SEP] Searching for CountTransformer does not give any resultsSorry, CountFeaturizer 9614It's certainly related, but not exactly a mean target encoding [CLS] [SEP] Also, it adds columns, not replaces, so will not yet work out of the box for string categorical data but that is more feedback on that PR, not to discuss here [CLS] [SEP] Why is it not mean target encoding [CLS] [SEP] But yeah let's not divert too much here thumbs up So as a summary of the actual questions we need to answer in this order [CLS] [SEP] Do we keep the current CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] If not, the idea is to split it in different classes, one class for each type of encoding currently 'onehot' and 'ordinal' encoding [CLS] [SEP] If we split in multiple classes, we could ideally [CLS] [SEP] use OneHotEncoder for the 'onehot' encoding, but this class already exists [CLS] [SEP] So, do we integrate the new 'onehot' encoding which supports strings and has different parameters in the existing OneHotEncoder class [CLS] [SEP] Or do we choose another name [CLS] [SEP] eg DummyEncoder. If we choose to integrate into the existing OneHotEncoder, are we OK with the following consequences: we deprecate a bunch of the keywords attributes of OneHotEncoder, and a specific usecase automatically ignoring unseen values within the range of seen values will not be possible anymore after deprecation period [CLS] [SEP] Most of the discussion above was about question 3 the complex details of how to integrate CategoricalEncoder encoding 'onehot' into OneHotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] But let's first agree on a decision for the first 2 questions [CLS] [SEP] the other factor for me is that everyone thinks the current auto mode in. OneHotEncoder is weird [CLS] [SEP] its implementation converting coo to csr is also. weird [CLS] [SEP] it deserves a redesign [CLS] [SEP] and telling people if you want to one hot. encode strings, go to CategoricalEncoder instead is awkward, because OHE. is already intended for categoricals [CLS] [SEP] hrm [CLS] [SEP] I guess we kept OneHotEncoder because it's more efficient when it can be used [CLS] [SEP] Ideally we would get rid of all the weird behaviors [CLS] [SEP] I kinda had wanted to deprecate it but then we didn't [CLS] [SEP] In my POC PR LINKLINK, I deprecated almost everything of OneHotEncoder, except its name [CLS] [SEP] It's not much more efficient [CLS] [SEP] And if LabelEncoder had fast paths for ints. in range, if justified, that would be good enough [CLS] [SEP] amueller, are you persuaded by the issue that we ultimately want different additional parameters for example drop first, nan handling depending on the encoding, and that justifies having a different discrete encoder for each encoding format [CLS] [SEP] I'll try to look at this in the spring break in two weeks, ok [CLS] [SEP] not sure if I'll have time before that thumbs down I hope this isn't the wrong place to ask but what does the current implementation do with tables that are mixed categorical and non categorical within one column [CLS] [SEP] Taking the example from LINKLINK. Consider the dataframe CODESCODES which equals: CODELCODEL. DictVectorizer gives exactly what I need in this case [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. This gives: CODELCODEL. We can see the features names of the columns with: CODELCODEL. It would be great if the new CategoricalEncoder had an option to do the same [CLS] [SEP] I don't think we intend to handle that kind of mixed case. That’s a shame [CLS] [SEP] One simple sub case is where a column is numerical but has some missing values [CLS] [SEP] A simple solution is to convert the NaNs into empty strings and then use DictVectorizer as in my example above [CLS] [SEP] This effectively creates a new feature for when the value is missing but leaves the numerical values unchanged otherwise [CLS] [SEP] I have found this a very useful technique [CLS] [SEP] Will the new CategoricalEncoder be able to do something similar [CLS] [SEP] we've considered allowing users to have NaN treated as a separate category. or similar [CLS] [SEP] but that's not the same as handling arbitrary numeric values as. different from strings [CLS] [SEP] That sounds good [CLS] [SEP] You are right there are two use cases [CLS] [SEP] Let me explain a particular example of where treating numeric values as different from strings has been useful for me [CLS] [SEP] It may be that there is a better solution [CLS] [SEP] Say you have an integer numeric feature which takes a large range of values [CLS] [SEP] However you suspect that for some small values, the precise value is significant [CLS] [SEP] For larger values you suspect this isn’t the case [CLS] [SEP] A simple thing to do is to convert all small values to strings, run DictVectorizer as above and then perform feature selection or just use your favorite classifier directly [CLS] [SEP] So you're using it for a non linear discretisation [CLS] [SEP] The next release is. likely to include a fixed width discretizer, but following on from a log. transform or a quantile transform it should act quite similar to what you. want [CLS] [SEP] But the log transform might alone be sufficient in your setting [CLS] [SEP] jnothman Yes in a sense except with a twist [CLS] [SEP] Say I suspect that some of the values from 1 [CLS] [SEP] 1024 are meaningful [CLS] [SEP] That is 22 indicates something specific which is quite different from 21 or 23 [CLS] [SEP] Taking logs won't help here [CLS] [SEP] But I want to leave all the values over 1024 as numerical as I don't think those specific values mean much [CLS] [SEP] It sounds like you know too much about your variable for a generic. transform to be the sort of thing you need [CLS] [SEP] jnothman To be a little clearer, I don't know that 22 is significant [CLS] [SEP] I just suspect that some values are but I don't know which ones or how many there are [CLS] [SEP] I have found the convert to a string and then DictVectorizer method to be very useful for discovering which these are [CLS] [SEP] lesshaste For the issue about NaNs as separate category, see LINKLINK. If you want to further discuss the specific non linear discretization or mixed numeric string encoding, feel free to open a new issue [CLS] [SEP] But would like to keep this one focused on the original issue, for example the naming and organisation in different classes of the CategoricalEncoder OneHotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] amueller that's fine [CLS] [SEP] I won't have time the coming two weeks to work on the PR that is blocked by this anyway [CLS] [SEP] After that I should also have time again to work on it [CLS] [SEP] amueller did you have time to give this a look [CLS] [SEP] amueller are you ok with that I go ahead with working on the PR to split CategoricalEncoder in OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder and with deprecating current arguments of OneHotEncoder [CLS] [SEP] Sorry for being absent [CLS] [SEP] Seems ok, but can you maybe give me two weeks so I can actually review [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] amueller no problem, for me the same: But, I am now planning to look at this again [CLS] [SEP] So if you could give this a look that would be welcome [CLS] [SEP] I have some work to do on the PR LINKLINK, so don't review that yet in detail you can look at it to have an idea of what we propose however [CLS] [SEP] I think the main question I want to see answered before I put a lot of time in it, is if you are OK with splitting up CategoricalEncoder into multiple classes, and in that case, if you are OK with re using OneHotEncoder which means deprecating some of its current strange features [CLS] [SEP] Those questions are summarized in LINKLINK and LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] and once we agree on that part, there is still a lot to discuss about the actual implementation in the PR thumbs up I updated the PR LINKLINK, ready for reviewI'll cautiously say I'm back thumbs up IMHO the most important thing is a universal API for example parameters and bbehavior patterns for all of encoders we discuss. P [CLS] [SEP] S [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] In the CODESCODES package, all encoders have a CODESCODES argument, similar to the CODESCODES in the old OneHotEncoder although it does not accept exactly the same kind of values [CLS] [SEP] See eg LINKLINK. So that is related to the current discussion we are having in LINKLINK about deprecating CODESCODES or not [CLS] [SEP] For the rest I think there are not really conflicting keywords they have some others specific to dataframes which we won't add to sklearn at this point [CLS] [SEP] The naming for OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder at least is consistent with the CODESCODES package [CLS] [SEP]
