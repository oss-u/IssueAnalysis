After the conda installation, the Jupyter notebook does not start [CLS] [SEP] There is a command window, which shows up for 1 2 seconds but disappears [CLS] [SEP] The Spyder does work properly so far [CLS] [SEP] More background information here: Windows 7, used to have an older version Anaconda, tried to update but found nothing worked after update [CLS] [SEP] Uninstalled, and reinstalled the latest version Anaconda 4 [CLS] [SEP] 0 with python2 [CLS] [SEP] 7 64bit [CLS] [SEP] Neither Spyder or Jupyter launches afterwards [CLS] [SEP] Did conda update all [CLS] [SEP] Found Spyder works but not Jupyter Notebook [CLS] [SEP] Can you get an Anaconda command prompt and run CODESCODES in it [CLS] [SEP] It probably won't work, but you should get an error message saying what's failing [CLS] [SEP] takluyver, Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] I just tried, and found it actually works by running from the command window [CLS] [SEP] The problem looks like that the Jupyter notebook shortcut in the Windows start menu is messed up [CLS] [SEP] I wonder if that's left over from the older version of Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] The shortcut properties might tell you what it's trying to call there may be a wrong path to Anaconda or something [CLS] [SEP] Closing as I don't think there's anything wrong in our code; feel free to keep using comments to work out what's going on [CLS] [SEP] Did you fix this problem [CLS] [SEP] I got this problem as well [CLS] [SEP] Jupyter is launching from the cmd but not from the Windows shortcut [CLS] [SEP] Can you look at the properties of the Windows shortcut to see what it's launching [CLS] [SEP] The shortcut is something that Anaconda makes, so we don't directly control it [CLS] [SEP] i looked at the properties [CLS] [SEP] this is what it's launching: HOME Yes, the problem was resolved [CLS] [SEP] The shortcut was the issue [CLS] [SEP] I had to. manually change the Shortcut target in windows 7 to the following: Let me know if works [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, jap, using jupyter notebook [CLS] [SEP] exe as shortcut target did the trick [CLS] [SEP] thank you very much [CLS] [SEP] Thanks hlignin [CLS] [SEP] If anyone wants to follow up the shortcut issue, the LINKLINK repo is probably the place to report it [CLS] [SEP] This is my environment [CLS] [SEP] I've experienced the same problem [CLS] [SEP] This is the default target of Jupyter Notebook shortcut [CLS] [SEP] in my case. In here, CODESCODES caused the problem [CLS] [SEP] So, I solved the problem with following solutions [CLS] [SEP] Please choose your preferred method [CLS] [SEP] Add a new CODESCODES in system variables [CLS] [SEP] Go to CODESCODES, add a new CODESCODES in system variables [CLS] [SEP] Change CODESCODES to path [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES ⇒ CODESCODES. Change CODESCODES to CODESCODES and add in system variables [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES ⇒ CODESCODES. Go to CODESCODES, add a new CODESCODES in system variables [CLS] [SEP] Thanks for the detailed write up [CLS] [SEP] Someone should probably report this to. Anaconda, because they make the start menu shortcut [CLS] [SEP] hwyncho great work [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] Hi, I looked at my set up and the icons have the following properties: this part is missing from the target text due to limit on the taget text box in icon properties pop up: ts jupyter notebook script [CLS] [SEP] py. Two questions: I think the missing part of the file path is causing a problem [CLS] [SEP] Would you agree [CLS] [SEP] The second entry is not point to the envs version of cwp [CLS] [SEP] py, which could also be causing a problem [CLS] [SEP] Would you agree [CLS] [SEP] If the first is correct, I believe the only way to correct is for me to change my User folder name which seems quite problematic for Win 10 [CLS] [SEP] Any suggestions [CLS] [SEP] Many Thanks, Alan.1 [CLS] [SEP] I don't know if that's a problem affecting the actual value, or just its display in the properties dialog [CLS] [SEP] If it is affecting the actual value, it could very well be the problem [CLS] [SEP] I'm not entirely sure what CODESCODES does, but I suspect it doesn't matter that it's not pointing to the one in the env [CLS] [SEP] You're better off asking Anaconda people about it [CLS] [SEP] Hi, I have the same issue here as well, Jupyter opens from the command line but not from the shortcut [CLS] [SEP] How do I inspect the shortcut to see where it is linking to [CLS] [SEP] I can't find the shortcut in the Anaconda3 folder [CLS] [SEP] Just solved this for the windows shortcut on Windows 8 [CLS] [SEP] My windows user has a space in the name, so in the shortcut I had to wrap the USERPROFILE path with double quotes as USERPROFILE. Still have been unable to get the shortcut within anaconda navigator working [CLS] [SEP] JoomSavvy Thanks [CLS] [SEP] Put USERPROFILE in double quotes [CLS] [SEP] now the shortcut is working [CLS] [SEP] JoomSavvy Thanks, it worked for me [CLS] [SEP] It appears your doc and code are not longer in sync for example running jupyter notebook fails [CLS] [SEP] Running jupyter notebook works however [CLS] [SEP] I tried to open jupyter from anaconda command prompt and also from navigator but for both it doesn't open up [CLS] [SEP] Instead of Internet explorer microsoft edge comes up but doesn't open jupyter and gets close automatically [CLS] [SEP] what could be the issue [CLS] [SEP] P [CLS] [SEP] S [CLS] [SEP] i am able to open spider [CLS] [SEP] Eyshika if you enter CODESCODES in a command prompt what is the exact, full output you see in the terminal [CLS] [SEP] Just copy paste the un abridged edited output into a new comment [CLS] [SEP] Even if a browser doesn't open up you should be able to manually open a browser and navigate to CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Also, I'd recommend to never use Internet Explorer, basically for anything but in particular I don't think the notebook works with it [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. Also, if I should not open it on Internet explorer then which browser is recommended [CLS] [SEP] Chrome and Firefox are well supported [CLS] [SEP] Edge should be fine, so I'm a bit surprised [CLS] [SEP] If you grab that full url that has the token and put it in Edge, does it do the same weird behavior [CLS] [SEP] It works now, with url [CLS] [SEP] i don't know why it was showing error [CLS] [SEP] But now it's not giving me any output on python3 jupyterAny errors in the output on the terminal you started it from [CLS] [SEP] Hi I have the same problem on windows 10 [CLS] [SEP] Both Jupyter and Spider cannot be launched [CLS] [SEP] I tried all your solutions mentioned above, but still it is not working [CLS] [SEP] My problem was my user's folder had a space in folder name [CLS] [SEP] After creating a new user and switching to that windows user, windows shortcuts and links from within' Anaconda worked fine [CLS] [SEP] Windows 8 [CLS] [SEP] 1 64 Bit [CLS] [SEP] Latest Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] Note: I ended up uninstalling an reinstalling Anaconda but my sense is the problem was really just the space in the windows user username user folder [CLS] [SEP] rgbkrk you were right, It works perfectly now tatullia When you type jupyter notebook in your prompt it must be giving you some url, use that url to open jupyterTrying to update, re installed completely and now I get this error [CLS] [SEP] megamindbrian What is the error you are getting [CLS] [SEP] I tried installing with pip and got py36.
