hey guys, i have this problem when i try to launch jupyter, the i got kernel error in the top right corner, i do tried to make python 2 kernel in jupyter so i followed some toturials about make environments then things start to get missy and errors showed up so i deleted them envs and kernel error is ON [CLS] [SEP] and when i click it i got this: result yield gen [CLS] [SEP] maybe future method self, args, kwargs. raise exc info self [CLS] [SEP] exc info.

FileNotFoundError: The system cannot find the file specified. thanks in advance and please help me, i reinstalled anacodna btw and still same error [CLS] [SEP] takluyver i found the soultion, the problem was, i made an environments then i deleted them, there were refrences for those envs, soultion: used this in cmd: python m ipykernel install user Yup, that's what I would have suggested [CLS] [SEP] Thanks for working it out yourself [CLS] [SEP] For other people who might read this: you can see kernelspecs which may contain references to deleted envs by running: CODELCODEL brother takluyver can you give me a complete steps to install python 2 kernel in notebook beside the python 3, because the start of the problem got from doing wrong steps, thank you very much and by the way, my solution brought up from YOU, so thank you very much thumbs up Have a look at the instructions here: LINKLINK I know you closed this, but I've tried literally all day and all recommendations on all the threads I could find [CLS] [SEP] Kernels: CODELCODEL. The kernel error is: CODESCODES. I even uninstalled all Anaconda distributions and Python distributions, re installed them, and still same issue [CLS] [SEP] At a loss at this point [CLS] [SEP] Any guidance [CLS] [SEP] Thanks in advance [CLS] [SEP] Try deleting that kernelspec path the CODESCODES one, assuming that's what is failing to launch [CLS] [SEP] It should fall back on running the kernel in the same Python as the notebook server [CLS] [SEP] Thank you that worked [CLS] [SEP] Now I need to reinstall all the libraries [CLS] [SEP] Appreciated [CLS] [SEP] How to delete kernelspec pathFind the path using CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Then you can navigate to that in your file manager and delete it, or do it from the terminal CODESCODES on Unix; if you're on Windows, you'll have to look it up. Thank you: That worked for me abdolrhman you're a wizard [CLS] [SEP] abdolrhman takluyver: you solved my problem error log attached [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. peoplecure The problem source as you define it seems to undermine the benefits of creating sandbox environments [CLS] [SEP] Don't know why deleting one environment would affect the kernel operation [CLS] [SEP] Thank you, it worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Problem persists for me. jupyter kernelspec list.

ImportError: cannot import name 'create prompt application' [CLS] [SEP] please suggest Sivananda Panda LINKLINK Thank you so much [CLS] [SEP] it worked [CLS] [SEP] thanks abdolrhman it really worked just fine [CLS] [SEP] My kernel when running python3 was pointing to this error from Anaconda in Python2, so I was confused at the beginning, but it did work: DIf you would like to manage virtual environment for each notebook, install the following package: conda install nb conda. After that restart you environment, then you will be able to see different version of kernels based on their respective virtual enviornment [CLS] [SEP] More info LINKLINK. If you got an error running this, try to edit the command to: python3 m ipykernel install user [CLS] [SEP] for those who are using python3 version Thought this might help [CLS] [SEP] When doing a fresh install you need to delete the Jupyter library directory to clear leftovers [CLS] [SEP] On MacOS it is at: CODELCODEL. Hi, I am having same problem, But my condition is that, I have installed python2 then installed python3, that was working fine [CLS] [SEP] But then I uninstalled conda for 2, and conda for 3, then installed conda for python3, It was working but problem is that it runs with python2 [CLS] [SEP] Then I found that conda 2 was not deleted completely, because of that it was using python 2 when I try to install conda whatever version [CLS] [SEP] Then I deleted the conda for python 2 folder [CLS] [SEP] Then I installed conda for python3 now [CLS] [SEP] Its showing the same problem as above [CLS] [SEP] It was trying to load some file from deleted folder [CLS] [SEP] I have checked with. jupyter kernelspec list. showing new folder [CLS] [SEP] then installed this. python m ipykernel install.

Worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lotuninstall all package and folder of python + remove envirnment then install anaconda [CLS] [SEP] its work for me. For me, I did below steps from several opinions.1 [CLS] [SEP] Upgraded conda. conda update n base c default conda.2 [CLS] [SEP] Created new environment. conda create n myenv python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 5 jupyter. here I had verified that my installed python version is 3 [CLS] [SEP] 5 [CLS] [SEP] Hi, I installed anaconda and have been using python3 fine [CLS] [SEP] Then, I tried to install Julia so I could use it too [CLS] [SEP] However, I get a kernel error when I open a jupyter notebook [CLS] [SEP] As suggested way above, I tried from the terminal: jupyter kernelspec list. Available kernels: julia thumbs down [CLS] [SEP] 5 Users colehl Library Jupyter kernels julia thumbs down [CLS] [SEP] python3 Users colehl opt anaconda3 share jupyter kernels python3. The paths are clearly different here [CLS] [SEP] Is that the problem [CLS] [SEP] What should I do to fix this [CLS] [SEP] Hi colehl [CLS] [SEP] The paths look okay [CLS] [SEP] Kernels are found in different locations, but generally following the output of CODESCODES relative to the CODESCODES locations [CLS] [SEP] What is the complete error you see in the notebook and console window if different [CLS] [SEP] Do you know if you're using CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] So, after looking at what you said, I started over and went ahead and updated Anaconda, and then downloaded Julia and that seemed to have worked [CLS] [SEP] I’ll try that sequence on my fancier notebook and hopefully that cleans everything up [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, Hal [CLS] [SEP] This issue has been mentioned on Jupyter Community Forum [CLS] [SEP] There might be relevant details there: LINKLINK.
