Update the CODESCODES package it should be fixed by 4 [CLS] [SEP] 7 or newer [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK Same issue fixed for me by updating conda and reinstalling jupyter: CODELCODEL I faced similar issue [CLS] [SEP] This is what I did to fix the issue on Ubuntu: sudo apt get remove ipython. sudo apt get purge ipython. sudo apt get autoremove. pip install jupyter. ipython seemed to be the problem, hence removing it fixed the issue [CLS] [SEP] akashshah26595 Thanks [CLS] [SEP] That works and helps me a lot [CLS] [SEP] akashshah26595 You're great [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES for some reason switched my conda environment to Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] disabling Tensorflow which was installed on Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] noo it's not working. The error means that an executable called jupyter notebook is not on your PATH [CLS] [SEP] Since you are doing user installs on macOS, scripts are going in HOME Library Python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 7 bin, which needs to be on your PATH and isn't by default [CLS] [SEP] If that's the case, you can add it with: export PATH HOME Library Python 2 [CLS] [SEP] 7 bin: PATH. In mac os x, open [CLS] [SEP] bash profile file in nano and paste this command to it [CLS] [SEP] same to me: macos, updated to 3 [CLS] [SEP] 7 and then rolled back to 3 [CLS] [SEP] 5 python, but seems I have some link to python3 [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. I have done already CODESCODES. could you please help me [CLS] [SEP] Dunno how is it possible [CLS] [SEP] the following command was running smoothly: CODESCODES. why does it happen [CLS] [SEP] Executing. CODELCODEL. [CLS] [SEP] did not solve the issue [CLS] [SEP] I'm using Ubuntu 18 [CLS] [SEP] 04 [CLS] [SEP] It seems to me as though the installation has messed up somehow [CLS] [SEP] Try running: For Python 2. pip install upgrade force reinstall no cache dir jupyter. For Python 3. pip3 install upgrade force reinstall no cache dir jupyter. This should reinstall everything from PyPi [CLS] [SEP] This should solve the problem as I think running pip install ipython messed things up [CLS] [SEP] hemangjoshi37a. Thanks. It works for me [CLS] [SEP] hemangjoshi37a. Great [CLS] [SEP] totally solved my problem cabric dboyliao It's okay bros [CLS] [SEP] Awesome [CLS] [SEP] For me, on Windows, the CODESCODES script does not even get generated searched my file system for it [CLS] [SEP] I resorted to manually creating the following file and just running it: CODESCODES. CODELCODEL. I'm running Linux Mint 19 with python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 6 [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES gives me the same error: CODESCODES. I tried both the solutions provided by akashshah26595: sudo apt get remove ipython. sudo apt get purge ipython. sudo apt get autoremove. pip install jupyter. and hemangjoshi37a. CODESCODES. NONE of these solutions worked for me [CLS] [SEP] I still get the same error and nothing else [CLS] [SEP] Can anybody please help me sort this out [CLS] [SEP] jodobear, have you got CODESCODES error messages from CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] If so you need to remove those packages manually and try CODESCODES until it runs with no error [CLS] [SEP] Try jupyter notebook. it will tell you to install. sudo apt install jupyter notebook. now try jupyter notebook. works fineubuntu 18: try as mentioned above, pip3 install jupyter notebook. then just. jupyter notebookI had the same issue [CLS] [SEP] While running hemangjoshi37a command I've received the message that the directory packages being installed are not added to the Path [CLS] [SEP] I have added my python directory to the Path, ran mentioned. CODESCODES. and it worked [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, it worked for me [CLS] [SEP] On Mac OS High Sierra I had to disable SIP [CLS] [SEP] Mac OS system protection that blocks modifications in certain Library files [CLS] [SEP] To disable SIP restart holding command+R Open Terminal run command. CODESCODES. then. CODESCODES. then hemangjoshi37a's saved my previously installed Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] 7 and Anaconda for 3 [CLS] [SEP] 7. pip3 install upgrade force reinstall no cache dir jupyter. i faced this same issue severely thumbs down, and finally i found it alone. and its all abt RANSOMEWARE PROTECTION on my windows 10 pro [CLS] [SEP] it wont let u over write any files and folder by third party apps under this protection [CLS] [SEP] Open the Windows Security app by clicking the shield icon in the. task bar or searching the start menu for Defender [CLS] [SEP] Click the Virus & threat protection tile or the shield icon on the left menu bar and then click Ransomware protection [CLS] [SEP] Set the switch for Controlled folder access to OFF. and happy jupyter Had the same problem [CLS] [SEP] use CODESCODES instead of CODESCODES what is the wrong [CLS] [SEP] ➜ 3 time number jupyter notebook. Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': Not a directory For me to solve the problem [CLS] [SEP] instead of installing jupyter with CODESCODES as stated on the jupyter website. In terminal, simply do. CODESCODES. after. CODESCODES. then run. CODESCODES. to launch jupyter [CLS] [SEP] Cheers [CLS] [SEP] Had the same issue: What I did: Try Locating Anaconda Navigator on your Mac using Spotlight Search, Click Launch Jupyter notebook, Works perfectly on mine [CLS] [SEP] Also: Do the update afterwards: CODESCODES, then just simply run CODESCODES. Works Great now. Thaaaanks [CLS] [SEP] This solves my issue [CLS] [SEP] Hi [CLS] [SEP] Just a warning to everyone else [CLS] [SEP] Using autoremove f ing ruined my whole enviroment and it wasn't even the solution [CLS] [SEP] Now I have a bigger problem [CLS] [SEP] Thank you for telling people indiscriminately to use Autoremove like it was nothing and taking away our time [CLS] [SEP] Cheers [CLS] [SEP] I am using ubuntu and i had tried all the solutions above, and they didn't work for me [CLS] [SEP] I solved the problem using: sudo apt install jupyter notebookIt is probably because you used an env of python [CLS] [SEP] And in that env, the jupyter is not installed [CLS] [SEP] Just reinstall jupyter in that env [CLS] [SEP] works for me [CLS] [SEP] Thx [CLS] [SEP] For those who have tried all of the methods above and still have not get it to work, here is the solution for me: CODESCODES. or. CODESCODES. use CODESCODES or CODESCODES instead of CODESCODES if needed. Good luck [CLS] [SEP] ipython notebook. open this command and use thisif you are using anconda then use this coomand. ipython notebook. 4960. sudo apt install jupyter notebook. it worked for me. sudo apt install jupyter notebook. it will star downloading like this [CLS] [SEP] Reading package lists [CLS] [SEP] Done. Building dependency tree. Reading state information [CLS] [SEP] Done. The following additional packages will be installed: fonts font awesome fonts mathjax javascript common. jupyter nbextension jupyter js widgets libjs backbone libjs bootstrap. libjs bootstrap tour libjs codemirror libjs es6 promise libjs jed. libjs jquery libjs jquery typeahead libjs jquery ui libjs marked. libjs mathjax libjs moment libjs requirejs libjs requirejs text. libjs text encoding libjs underscore libjs xterm liblua5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 0 libluajit 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 libluajit 5 [CLS] [SEP] 1 common pandoc pandoc data python3 bleach python3 entrypoints. Work for me [CLS] [SEP] thanksNop. ipython notebook. Work fine. sudo apt install jupyter notebook. This is not working. Thank you very muchyes sure this is running [CLS] [SEP] This is the only solution that works for me [CLS] [SEP] yeah sure [CLS] [SEP] This is working fine [CLS] [SEP] There have been lots of great responses and sufficient success to warrant this issue's closure [CLS] [SEP] Should others encounter this same issue and have applied the suggested tips, we can either reopen it or create a new issue preferred [CLS] [SEP] Thanks to everyone for helping out with this issue [CLS] [SEP] I appreciate for that, JupyterLab is working with that [CLS] [SEP] Should I open the JupyterLab always in this way [CLS] [SEP] Could it cause any problem [CLS] [SEP] yes this is also working fine [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES. use python 3 and python3 [CLS] [SEP] 6. [CLS] [SEP] it's work for me [CLS] [SEP] tnks. yeah sure this working fine. Jupyter notebook stopped working once I logged out and logged in again [CLS] [SEP] This solution worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Beautiful [CLS] [SEP] Works great thanks hemangjoshi37a this is also working [CLS] [SEP] nhat416.
