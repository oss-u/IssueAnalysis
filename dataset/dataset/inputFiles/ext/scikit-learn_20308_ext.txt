 This issue is reserved for the LINKLINK on June 26, 2021 as a good first issue [CLS] [SEP] For non sprint contributors, please wait till July 1, 2021 to work on this issue [CLS] [SEP] Make sure you have the LINKLINK and LINKLINK installed [CLS] [SEP] Pick an estimator from the list below and leave a comment saying you are going to work on it [CLS] [SEP] This way we can keep track of what everyone is working on [CLS] [SEP] Remove the estimator from the list at: LINKLINK. Let's say you picked CODESCODES, run numpydoc validation as follows Adding the CODESCODES at the end helps with the regex [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. If you see failing test, please fix them by following the recommendation provided by the failing test [CLS] [SEP] If you see all the tests past, you do not need to do any additional changes [CLS] [SEP] Commit your changes [CLS] [SEP] Open a Pull Request with an opening message CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Note that each item should be submitted in a separate Pull Request [CLS] [SEP] Include the estimator name in the title of the pull request [CLS] [SEP] For example: DOC Ensures that StandardScaler passes numpydoc validation [CLS] [SEP] 20381 ARDRegression. 20374 AdaBoostClassifier. 20400 AdaBoostRegressor. 20536 AdditiveChi2Sampler. 20532 AffinityPropagation. 20544 AgglomerativeClustering. 20407 BaggingClassifier. 20498 BaggingRegressor. 20384 BayesianGaussianMixture. 20389 BayesianRidge.

With leonardorocc0 will be taking CODESCODES.

Yo también ando trabajando en ese con g4brielvs [CLS] [SEP] Tal vez puede haber un conflicto [CLS] [SEP] Taking over CODESCODES one [CLS] [SEP] LucyJimenez and I are working on CODESCODES. Ok, ahi cambiamos [CLS] [SEP] Estamos trabajando en CODESCODES con asnramos MattNP And I are working on CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] lacouth and I are working on CODESCODES I wonder if it's worth doing a regex for the return value of CODESCODES fit CODESCODES and do all of those at once [CLS] [SEP] Having them be consistent might also be good and that's probably many places [CLS] [SEP] I've found. CODELCODEL. which seems good [CLS] [SEP] Similar things are probably true for CODESCODES fit CODESCODES, CODESCODES predict CODESCODES, CODESCODES transform CODESCODES, CODESCODES predict proba CODESCODES etc NicolasMillerr and I will be working in CODESCODES I'm g4brielvs working on CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] working on CODESCODES w sebastiandres working on CODESCODES I'm working on CODESCODES.

Working on CODESCODES GraphicalLassoCV CODESCODES Working on CODESCODES EllipticEnvelope CODESCODES thomasjpfan I just realized that we are not considering functions or classes that are not estimators in this check [CLS] [SEP] I was just working on the plotting API, and the check is not run there [CLS] [SEP] It could be a nice addition to yield these extra functions and classes [CLS] [SEP] Working on CODESCODES ShrunkCovariance CODESCODES.
