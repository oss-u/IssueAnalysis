I would like to propose an additional instance method to the ensemble estimators to fit additional sub estimators [CLS] [SEP] I kluged up an implementation for gradient boosting that appears to work through my limited testing [CLS] [SEP] I was thinking the signature would be something like. CODELCODEL. If people think this would be a useful addition I would be willing to put together a PR, it seems like it should be straightforward to implement and add tests docs for [CLS] [SEP] This is definitely a feature we want [CLS] [SEP] The question is: what would be the best way to implement it in terms of API [CLS] [SEP] There is something slightly similar in the adaboost pr: 522 [CLS] [SEP] That implements predicting with a subset of the estimators, which is also very helpful [CLS] [SEP] What do you think does the scenario code look like, where a user wants CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] It is probably most useful in an interactive setting, righ [CLS] [SEP] There is a slightly related function in SGD, CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] That is actually for online learning, though, so it gets different data [CLS] [SEP] I'd like to get this feature with adding as little API an names as possible thumbs up. Btw, I wouldn't hash CODESCODES and CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] I don't see a reason to force the user to provide the same input data [CLS] [SEP] I would like to train a small number of sub estimators at a time and wait a relatively short time [CLS] [SEP] Then test it on my cross validation set and if my cv score is still falling, I can continue training [CLS] [SEP] As opposed to training a large number of sub estimators and waiting a long time several hours for me [CLS] [SEP] That was my motivation [CLS] [SEP] So I wasn't sure that would be a good idea [CLS] [SEP] Would. CODELCODEL. be acceptable [CLS] [SEP] Then if CODESCODES, we'll then train that many more estimators [CLS] [SEP] I agree that adding in n estimators parameter to the prediction method is nice, but I think you'll agree that it solves a different problem [CLS] [SEP] For my problem performing grid search over n estimators isn't really an option because it takes so long [CLS] [SEP] Until we agree on a proper interface to do that, you could use the following hack: CODELCODEL. Note that this only work for RandomForest and ExtraTrees [CLS] [SEP] The same trick cannot be used with Gradient Boosting [CLS] [SEP] See 1626 [CLS] [SEP] Would early stopping be an acceptable solution to you [CLS] [SEP] amueller I share the same opinion as glouppe here LINKLINK [CLS] [SEP] I like early stopping but it doesn't resolve this in my opinion [CLS] [SEP] Ok [CLS] [SEP] Then we should look for a solution that allows for early stopping and adding additional estimators [CLS] [SEP] Thinking about it a bit more, I think the CODESCODES method would be the right interface [CLS] [SEP] In SGD you can call CODESCODES either with the same data or new data and it keeps on learning [CLS] [SEP] The difference is that in SGD, if you manually iterate over batches, you get the original algorithm out [CLS] [SEP] For ensembles, that would not be true [CLS] [SEP] You would need to use the whole data on each call to CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] I like this suggestion [CLS] [SEP] What do other people think [CLS] [SEP] Just to clarify, what would exactly happen in CODESCODES in case of ensembles [CLS] [SEP] Would that add CODESCODES more estimators, where CODESCODES is the parameter value from the constructor [CLS] [SEP] or could we change that value [CLS] [SEP] Good question [CLS] [SEP] I also thought about that thumbs up actually, you would want to change that, right [CLS] [SEP] you could change that afterwards by CODESCODES but that feels awkward thumbs down. sorry for joining the discussion so late [CLS] [SEP] I agree that we need such a functionality, however, I'm not sure if CODESCODES is the best solution to the problem that jwkvam describes [CLS] [SEP] In order to do early stopping the user has to write some some code that basically repeatedly calls CODESCODES and then checks the CV error [CLS] [SEP] I'd rather propose the CODESCODES fit parameter that we discussed in the past: CODESCODES where CODESCODES will be called after each iteration and is passed the complete state of the estimator [CLS] [SEP] The callable could also return a value whether or not the training should proceed [CLS] [SEP] Using such an api one could implement not only early stopping but also custom reporting for example interactive plotting the training vs [CLS] [SEP] testing score and snapshoting all X iterations dump the estimator object and copy it to some location; this is great if you are running on EC2 spot instances or some other unreliable hardware ;. Even with such a CODESCODES API, however, I think there would be a need for an API to fit more estimators once the model has been fitted for example CODESCODES often one trains a model and does some introspection to find that its probably better to have run more iterations existing estimators use the CODESCODES parameter to implement such a functionality for example see CODESCODES here is the docstring of the parameter: CODELCODEL. Personally, I'd prefer CODESCODES or CODESCODES over CODESCODES warm start is quite implicit you have to: CODELCODEL. To me, fit more corresponds really to the partial fit that we have in. other estimators [CLS] [SEP] pprett I think there should be an easy way to do easy things [CLS] [SEP] a monitor api is very flexible but actually you want to do early stopping every time you use an estimator, right [CLS] [SEP] So there should be no need to write a callback to do that [CLS] [SEP] Also, it must be compatible with GridSearchCV [CLS] [SEP] I don't think so [CLS] [SEP] In CODESCODES, partial stands for partial access to the data: you expect that the data does not fit in memory at once so you fit with one chunk at a time and update the model incrementally while scanning through the data [CLS] [SEP] In this case we want to change the number of sub estimators but might want to reuse exactly the same data at each call [CLS] [SEP] For a similar reason ElasticNet has a CODESCODES constructor param instead of a CODESCODES method and SGDClassifier both has a CODESCODES param and a CODESCODES method: they serve different purposes [CLS] [SEP] I agree that the monitor API would be very useful in general for dealing with snapshoting, early stopping and such but would not solve the issue of growing the number of sub estimators in an interactive manner [CLS] [SEP] We could also have: CODELCODEL. Or even to grow by 110 10 more estimators: CODELCODEL. hum I didn't look to much into the warm start api that we have currently [CLS] [SEP] There is no central documentation for that, right [CLS] [SEP] We should really think about the organization of the docs [CLS] [SEP] We got quite some comments on that in the survey thumbs down. ogrisel I'd have to have a look at the SGD implementation to see the details but what is the difference in what actually happens between warm starts and partial fit [CLS] [SEP] I think we agree on the point of same changing data [CLS] [SEP] Does CODESCODES do several epochs and CODESCODES does not [CLS] [SEP] That would make sense to me, and then we should probably keep them separate [CLS] [SEP] If we already have the warm start api, we should definitely just implement that for the ensemble estimators [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES just prevents fit to forget about the previous state assuming that the inner state of the model will likely make it converge faster to the solution of the new call with the new hyperparameter [CLS] [SEP] 2013 1 30 Andreas Mueller. I think the main difference is the semantics: the main idea behind. CODESCODES is to converge more quickly but no matter what value. CODESCODES has you get the same solution [CLS] [SEP] Partial fit on the other hand, changes the underlying model [CLS] [SEP] Consider the. following example: CODELCODEL. can reuse the fitted weights from clf it might converge more quickly. under the hood CODESCODES resets the training state mode. the estimator adaptive learning rate for sgd. CODELCODEL. Disclaimer: This example might be pedantic because the differences in terms. of the learned weights is minimal but conceptually they are IMHO totally. different things [CLS] [SEP] Peter Prettenhofer. The CODESCODES API was initially introduced to allow faster computation of a series of identical linear models when using a path of regularizers CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] This is somewhat similar to iteratively growing the number of sub estimators in a boosted ensemble model so we could decide to reuse CODESCODES to adress that use case as well but if this API reveals cumbersome for boosted models it might be better to rethink it now that we have an additional use case [CLS] [SEP] I agree with pprett's analysis [CLS] [SEP] I don't know what to make of pprett analysis [CLS] [SEP] In the case of linear models, the estimator will converge to the same result, even when the warm start gets different data than the original fit [CLS] [SEP] If we warm started ensembles trees, that would not be the case [CLS] [SEP] We could try to assure that the data provided when warm starting is the same as the original [CLS] [SEP] At the moment, warm start refers to an optimization procedure, which there is none in tree based methods [CLS] [SEP] While CODESCODES retains all of the state of the estimator and just keeps on fitting [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand, subsequent calls to partial fit on batches lead to the same model as training on the whole data [CLS] [SEP] Again, this is different from the tree ensemble case [CLS] [SEP] I feel this goes back to my argument that this is more of a path algorithms than anything else thumbs up. So I see two possible solutions: make sure warm start is always called with the same data, then adding estimators would be warm starting [CLS] [SEP] If not, we need a third way to refit a given model [CLS] [SEP] Where are the docs for that currently, btw thumbs up. Why so [CLS] [SEP] Let the user decide how and what for he she want to use CODESCODES for [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. CODELCODEL. I agree that giving motivation would be helpful, for instance in this case: This is useful to efficiently compute a regularization path of ElasticNet models as done by the: func: CODESCODES function [CLS] [SEP] I thought the argument was about semantics [CLS] [SEP] I think a semantic is defined by giving the user some guarantee of what will happen [CLS] [SEP] That way the user doesn't need to know all the details of the algorithm [CLS] [SEP] I thought the guarantee of CODESCODES was warm start doesn't change the result, while the guarantee of CODESCODES was iterating over batches doesn't change the result [CLS] [SEP] If there is no guarantee, then I don't see how there can be common semantics [CLS] [SEP] We provide guarantee to the user that if he provides the same data again with warm start true he will get the same results just faster [CLS] [SEP] But we should not prevent the user to use different data if he makes an informed guess that warm starting on the new data will help him solve his problem for example solving on the new data faster if he makes the assumption that the new data is distributed reasonably similarly to the first data and hence starting the optimizer from the previous position should speeds things up [CLS] [SEP] For linear estimators that is ok [CLS] [SEP] But if you want to use CODESCODES on ensembles, it will have a very different semantic all of a sudden [CLS] [SEP] Indeed growing a boosted ensemble on changing data is weird and probably useless unless if it's a way to inject some randomization for some meta meta ensemble estimator that does bagging on boosted models maybe [CLS] [SEP] I don't think we should try to enforce that the data does not change across calls though [CLS] [SEP] Let's just document the expected usage scenario for that option in the docstring instead [CLS] [SEP] ok [CLS] [SEP] So basically the docstring should say use warm start with the same data unless you know exactly what you are doing [CLS] [SEP] Fine with me [CLS] [SEP] Anyone opposed to using CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] I still have to have a look at how that is handled in SGD and ENet, though [CLS] [SEP] No, not useless: it's one specific sub sampling strategy [CLS] [SEP] The practical. difference with an online method is that you want the batch to be big [CLS] [SEP] Peter Prettenhofer wrote: So CODESCODES in SGDClassifier can not be used for model selection [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand, CODESCODES could be used to find the best. CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] The more I think about it, the more confusing it gets for me thumbs down. Btw, is there any reason that CODESCODES is an init parameter. and CODESCODES is a function [CLS] [SEP] Wouldn't it be easier if CODESCODES also was an init parameter [CLS] [SEP] Because CODESCODES is a specific strategy that might differ from the. strategy used in CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] I think it would be confusing [CLS] [SEP] The goal of CODESCODES is to be a. building block usable in an out of core framework [CLS] [SEP] Using CODESCODES for this. purpose could lead to fairly catastrophic results [CLS] [SEP] I don't understand your argument [CLS] [SEP] What CODESCODES does is basically forget model, call CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Hm maybe what you mean is that CODESCODES might need to do less work than CODESCODES because CODESCODES needs to store the sufficient statistics of the previous data and fit doesn't need to do that [CLS] [SEP] It can do more [CLS] [SEP] Typically it shuffles the data before calling partial. fit [CLS] [SEP] It may also divide it into mini batches of a user selectable size [CLS] [SEP] It might be the case [CLS] [SEP] It might be also that fit needs to do additional. work to turn a large batch dataset into a set of mini batch ones [CLS] [SEP] hm ok maybe this is not so important right now [CLS] [SEP] I'd like to minimize the number of mechanisms we have in sklearn, and we definitely need one more [CLS] [SEP] for efficient model selection [CLS] [SEP] In the coordinate decent algorithms, the CODESCODES option was introduced exactly for this purpose [CLS] [SEP] I am not sure it is general enough to really do that what if there is more than one parameter [CLS] [SEP] and it doesn't fulfil this requirement any more in SGDClassifier [CLS] [SEP] just removed a lot of the previous comment as I was repeating myself [CLS] [SEP] I don't understand this last remark [CLS] [SEP] warm start is perfectly valid for SGDClassifier in addition to CODESCODES: right now SGDClassifier does not have convergence check early stopping [CLS] [SEP] But as soon as it has, warm starting will make it possible to compute the regularization path faster, exactly as for ElasticNet [CLS] [SEP] SGDClassifier does CODESCODES epochs of updates, then stops [CLS] [SEP] Where it ends up after CODESCODES steps depends heavily on where you started [CLS] [SEP] Even if you do early stopping, this would be early stopping on the validation set, not early stopping of the optimization [CLS] [SEP] SGDClassfier does not have the goal to fully optimize the objective to the end [CLS] [SEP] So where you will end up will depend on the initialization [CLS] [SEP] In particular, for early stopping on a validation set [CLS] [SEP] it could be better to do less iterations, leading to lower bias [CLS] [SEP] In particular, I don't think a regularization path for alpha makes sense in the SGD setting [CLS] [SEP] The path is a sequence of optima [CLS] [SEP] SGD will never find the optimum, so the places you'll end up will probably depend as much on the scaling of the learning rate as on the actual regularization [CLS] [SEP] For linear models, the problem is convex [CLS] [SEP] If n iter is big enough, SGD with a good learning schedule will converge to the optimum if you don't stop before convergence [CLS] [SEP] The convergence speed when getting closer to the optimum is just not as good as coordinate descent but this is a different issue [CLS] [SEP] so we agree: the models will be different unless n iter is big enough and the schedule is just right which are unlikely in practice [CLS] [SEP] also a guarantee of the form “results will be the same if the other settings are appropriately tuned“ doesn't really sound like a guarantee [CLS] [SEP] Olivier Grisel schrieb: Diese Nachricht wurde von meinem Android Mobiltelefon mit K 9 Mail gesendet [CLS] [SEP] So what about. CODELCODEL. Is that an acceptable usage pattern [CLS] [SEP] Or do you want these as parameters to CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] In SGD, CODESCODES is an CODESCODES parameter according to the docs [CLS] [SEP] Let's revive the discussion [CLS] [SEP] in 1044 GaelVaroquaux said he still prefers CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Currently, I think CODESCODES is more in the right direction, but I don't have a strong opinion [CLS] [SEP] ogrisel pprett glouppe larsmans what is your opinion on the usage pattern I posted above [CLS] [SEP] Or would you like to have another interface using CODESCODES or CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] What I dislike about using the 'warm start' is that currently the. contract with scikit learn estimators is that you can call 'fit' and get. a valid useful answer regardless of the history of the object [CLS] [SEP] It may go. faster or slower, but it's somewhat fool proof [CLS] [SEP] If you pass different. data to an ensemble estimator, and use the 'warm start' to fit more. estimators, you will get nonsens [CLS] [SEP] I am worried about having to write.'defensive' code to avoid such problems [CLS] [SEP] how would CODESCODES work in our setting is this correct: CODELCODEL. so it would take arbitrary CODESCODES or just CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Personally, I'm in favor of a CODESCODES since the use case that our current CODESCODES serves is quite different and CODESCODES is more explicit [CLS] [SEP] I am also not very happy with the name CODESCODES in case of ensembles [CLS] [SEP] From my point of view, that name suggests that it will build some estimators out of the total number requested in the constructor, but not more [CLS] [SEP] If we go for CODESCODES then what would be the specification [CLS] [SEP] You set CODESCODES in the constructor and calling CODESCODES append CODESCODES more estimators [CLS] [SEP] Just like amueller did above [CLS] [SEP] Well I am not against that pattern, but that does not seem very intuitive to me nevertheless [CLS] [SEP] From a very practical point of view, I like CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] It is explicit [CLS] [SEP] No explanation required [CLS] [SEP] However, it adds another function to our API [CLS] [SEP] I have no strong opinion yet, these remarks simply reflect what I think at the moment. I am not completely against adding a function, but I wouldn't like it to be to specific to the ensembles [CLS] [SEP] I really do see a connection to the path algorithms so I think sharing an interface would be nice [CLS] [SEP] Consider the following hypothetical situation maybe not so realistic: You fitted an ensemble but now you see that you underfit and want to make your trees deeper let's say we implemented that [CLS] [SEP] This would be another example of path like behavior [CLS] [SEP] Would you also do that via CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Or add a CODESCODES function [CLS] [SEP] I guess there is a trade off between generality and explicitness [CLS] [SEP] GaelVaroquaux The contract with CODESCODES is imho that if you iterate over the data in batches, you will get the same result out [CLS] [SEP] That will definitely not be the case if used here [CLS] [SEP] So by design we would break the contract [CLS] [SEP] Thinking about it again, maybe there is room for a new method which we could use to implement 1626 [CLS] [SEP] I wouldn't mind calling it CODESCODES, but in the sense of CODESCODES not in the sense of CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] So imho we should either do CODESCODES + maybe defensive programming or add another method that we can generally use to fit along a parameter path [CLS] [SEP] Would CODESCODES then be defensive or not [CLS] [SEP] thumbs up. thumbs down on defensive [CLS] [SEP] I'd rather document it well and let the user decides what. is good for oneself [CLS] [SEP] On 11 February 2013 22:14, Andreas Mueller wrote: I would also be against defensive [CLS] [SEP] I was just wondering if adding the function really solved an issue or if we just added another way to do warm starts [CLS] [SEP] Both have the same defensive not defensive problem, right [CLS] [SEP] My apologies if I'm simply repeating what has already been said [CLS] [SEP] But it seems like you could split estimators into two classes: those that freeze parameters once they are fit ensembles, DTs, and those that don't linear models [CLS] [SEP] By that I mean with warm start you won't refit the first n sub estimators of an ensemble or the existing splits in a decision tree [CLS] [SEP] The lack of being able to reach anywhere in the parameter space with warm start for ensembles and DTs makes me think that an instance method would be more appropriate [CLS] [SEP] If an instance method is chosen, does it need to be more general as amueller noted [CLS] [SEP] If at some point someone wanted the ability to increase the max depth of the sub estimators, that could also be handled with CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] For what it's worth, I would also be against defensive [CLS] [SEP] As GaelVaroquaux pointed out earlier it provides a sub sampling strategy, for instance, if your training data doesn't fit in main memory [CLS] [SEP] After some thoughts, I think we should see the bigger picture here [CLS] [SEP] In a near future, I would like to implement generic meta ensembles that could combine any kind of estimators together [CLS] [SEP] What I rather see is a combination mechanism that would take as input a list of fitted estimators and would produce a meta estimator combining them all [CLS] [SEP] In practice, I think we can achieve that without adding any new function to our API [CLS] [SEP] For example, one could simply pass such a list of fitted estimators to the constructor of the meta ensemble [CLS] [SEP] In terms of API, one could roughly implement such ensembles in the following way: a Bagging: constructor: CODESCODES optional, CODESCODES 0, a list CODESCODES of fitted estimators optional [CLS] [SEP] fit: extend CODESCODES with CODESCODES new instances of CODESCODES fitted over bootstrap copies of the training samples [CLS] [SEP] If no base estimator is given, then it is equivalent to combining the estimators in CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] b Stacking: constructor: CODESCODES optional, CODESCODES 0, a list CODESCODES of fitted estimators optional [CLS] [SEP] fit: extend CODESCODES with CODESCODES new instances of CODESCODES fitted of bootstrap samples, then refit a model over the predictions of the estimators [CLS] [SEP] c Forest: constructor: CODESCODES optional, CODESCODES 0, a list CODESCODES of fitted estimators or a forest optional [CLS] [SEP] fit: extend CODESCODES with CODESCODES new instances of CODESCODES fitted over the training samples [CLS] [SEP] Here we could also check whether the estimators in CODESCODES are forests or decision trees [CLS] [SEP] Forests would be flattened in order to put all trees on the same level [CLS] [SEP] Also, in such a framework, computation of an ensemble could easily be distributed over several machines: build your estimators; pickle them; then recombine them into one single meta estimator [CLS] [SEP] One could even wrap that interface into a MapReduce cluster, without digging into our implementation at all [CLS] [SEP] What do you think [CLS] [SEP] I am aware this is only relevant to some kind of ensembles though [CLS] [SEP] For instance, GBRT and AdaBoost are in my opinion more suited to either CODESCODES or CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Just to be clear, to extend a forest, one would do something like: CODELCODEL. What is the motivation of that interface [CLS] [SEP] I am totally with you in supporting more ensemble methods [CLS] [SEP] I just feel it is quite awkward to have a different interface for GBRT and random forest [CLS] [SEP] I don't really see the motivation for that [CLS] [SEP] If the main motivation is to distribute embarassingly parallel jobs, then I think we should attack this by implementing a more powerful parallelization [CLS] [SEP] Doing it the way you described seems pretty manual and hacky [CLS] [SEP] Basically I feel your proposal just solves a very special case and leaves most cases unsolved [CLS] [SEP] Well ok [CLS] [SEP] I just feel that extending boosted like ensembles and average like ensembles are quite different things [CLS] [SEP] What is the use case for your interface except parallelization [CLS] [SEP] Or better: in what use cases do you need a different interface for boosted ensembles and bagging [CLS] [SEP] The use case is when you want to combine several estimators together [CLS] [SEP] It is natural for average like ensembles, but makes no sense in boosted ensembles [CLS] [SEP] In that perspective, I see extending an estimator as combining it with more base estimators [CLS] [SEP] So the setting is that you have trained some bagging estimators and want to combine them together, right [CLS] [SEP] In which setting do you want to do that except for parallelization [CLS] [SEP] It is not so clear to me but maybe I'm overlooking something obvious [CLS] [SEP] In case of Stacking the estimators might be completely different say to you want to merge forests with svms [CLS] [SEP] Indirectly, this could also be used to implement subsampling strategies or for monitoring the fitting process [CLS] [SEP] I'm not sure I get the stacking example [CLS] [SEP] I would have imagined that if we had a stacking interface, you could specify one estimator as the base estimator and another as the one on top [CLS] [SEP] As I see it, the point of stacking is to combine the predictions of estimators of different nature [CLS] [SEP] The more diverse they are, often the better [CLS] [SEP] Ok, so the base estimators would be different [CLS] [SEP] But then we could also build this into the interface for stacking, right [CLS] [SEP] Resolved with 2570. jwkvam We recently agreed in 2570 to implement this feature using the CODESCODES parameter [CLS] [SEP] It is now implemented in GBRT [CLS] [SEP] I'll try to update the forests with the same mechanism before the release [CLS] [SEP] glouppe You're right, I forgot I had written this for any ensemble [CLS] [SEP] But really I just wanted it for GBRT thumbs up so in my haste, I decided this issue was resolved [CLS] [SEP] If you like you can reopen it and close it when you are done, it doesn't matter to me [CLS] [SEP]
