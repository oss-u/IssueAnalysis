Hi everyone. I've just downloaded and installed Anaconda3 2018 [CLS] [SEP] 12 Windows x86 64 to my PC running windows 10 [CLS] [SEP] When I start Anaconda prompt and type;. Traceback most recent call last: import sqlite3. from sqlite3 [CLS] [SEP] dbapi2 import. from sqlite3 import.

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysqlite2'. I've already check sqlite is list on Anaconda's installed packages, and also search web but notting found [CLS] [SEP] I think Its not about jupyter notebook itself, because when I try to import sqllite;.

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found [CLS] [SEP] getting same error. thanks.Ä°brahimMe too having same errorIf this is still a problem, you probably want to ask the Anaconda team about it: LINKLINK I've just installed previous version, it's working now [CLS] [SEP] On Wed, Jan 16, 2019, 13:27 Thomas Kluyver wrote: I'm having this exact problem too [CLS] [SEP] UPDATE w FIX: I fixed this problem by adding CODESCODES to my PATH [CLS] [SEP] I am also having this issue with version 2018 [CLS] [SEP] 12.

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found [CLS] [SEP] Thanks Deborshi1993, the solution workaround has worked [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] it works [CLS] [SEP] thumbs up. how did you add CODESCODES in your path [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. Deborshi1993 do you have a link to that issue [CLS] [SEP] GiorgioBalestrieri What kind of link are you referring to [CLS] [SEP] Deborshi1993 you mentioned there is an issue with the 64 Bit version of Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] Do you have a source for that [CLS] [SEP] GiorgioBalestrieri It's with 64Bit Windows version of Anaconda, and this is just a common issue with a lot of Windows users including me and few of my colleagues [CLS] [SEP] Please feel free to share your views if for you it is working [CLS] [SEP] thumbs up. best regards, Deborshi. Deborshi1993 I think I wasn't clear, I was not questioning whether it's an issue with Anaconda, I was trying to get visibility on the issue thread where this is being tracked [CLS] [SEP] I faced the exact the same problem also on Windows, also Anaconda 64bit, but for some reason only for some environments, specifically some using Python 3 [CLS] [SEP] I was asking for a source because if there is a known issue it should be tracked somewhere, and I'm quite sure Continuum would have someone actively working on it [CLS] [SEP] It would be useful for people reading this thread being able to check the status of that issue and for people working on that issue to know it's cascading into things like this one [CLS] [SEP] GiorgioBalestrieri Yes, you are right [CLS] [SEP] But also for me, I had to go through the threads to find an exact approach to solve this issue [CLS] [SEP] Hence, I wrote the exact process I followed to bring up Jupyter Notebook and this worked with some [CLS] [SEP] I am sorry to say, there is no other source I can refer you at this moment [CLS] [SEP] thumbs up for me, since i used anaconda64 i activate the env and installed, CODESCODES. and it solved.

CODESCODES. I tried it and it works for me. CODESCODES. CODESCODES neither of these solutions worked for me [CLS] [SEP] please suggest [CLS] [SEP] This worked for me as well [CLS] [SEP] I copied the sqlite3 [CLS] [SEP] dll into the system32 folder [CLS] [SEP] I was getting error messages trying to install the google cloud SDK [CLS] [SEP] This fixed it [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK.

I tried all above solutions but didn't work for me until I install latest version of Microsft Visual C++It seems that Anaconda python 3 [CLS] [SEP] x has the problem, we can fix it as. Deborshi1993 thank you Simpler Solution would be just to activate base. Open CMD. and type activate base. Thank you.
