Hi, I am new to Python and Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] I installed anaconda and install Scipy [CLS] [SEP] When I try import scipy in the Python in command prompt on the Anaconda prompt, it works fine as below. CODELCODEL. But when I use the same in the Jupyter notebook, I am getting. CODELCODEL. Please let me know how to solve this issue [CLS] [SEP] Usually that indicates that the notebook is running with a different Python or in a different environment from Python in the command prompt [CLS] [SEP] Check CODESCODES to see which Python it's running in, and CODESCODES to see where it's looking for imports [CLS] [SEP] Thanks takluyver, I see the difference [CLS] [SEP] The path from the command prompt shows. Where as the notebook shows. I had installed py27 and py35 on my system [CLS] [SEP] Can you please let me know how to change to path which is used in command prompt [CLS] [SEP] try a CODESCODES, CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] That will likely fix the notebook can see your Python 3 kernel [CLS] [SEP] Then create a CODESCODES CODESCODES from the dashboard [CLS] [SEP] Hi, I'm encountering the same problem here [CLS] [SEP] I've installed successfully tensorflow and anaconda on my Mac OS [CLS] [SEP] Everything goes fine in spyder, while when programming in Jupyter notebook, some modules seem to be not exist and cannot be imported [CLS] [SEP] Error: no module name matplotlib, scipy [CLS] [SEP] Then I checked the system and found: In spyder, sys [CLS] [SEP] executable is Users abc anaconda bin python ;. In Jupyter, sys [CLS] [SEP] executable is Users abc anaconda envs tensorflow bin python no matter whether I activate tensorflow in terminal. Both python version are 2 [CLS] [SEP] 11 [CLS] [SEP] Now I want to change the python path in Jupyter to which spyder uses [CLS] [SEP] Can anyone please tell me how to do this [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] See separate issue: 1580. CODELCODEL. It works [CLS] [SEP] Thank you so much for your help, really saved my life [CLS] [SEP] Happy coding [CLS] [SEP] I tried doing what Carreau suggested and although I was able to then import scipy it made it so I could now no longer import matplotlib which I could previously [CLS] [SEP] You have one Python environment with scipy installed but not matplotlib, and one with matplotlib installed but not Scipy [CLS] [SEP] Whichever one you pick, you'll have to work out how to install the missing package into it, using conda or pip [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK. LINKLINK. LINKLINK. LINKLINK. I have a similar problem [CLS] [SEP] My problem is that when I launch my anaconda environment and access to Python script [CLS] [SEP] the next line works well: from imgaug import augmenters as iaa. but when I execute the same line in jupyter notebook or spyder both in anaconda, the error occur [CLS] [SEP] In Python script, the sys [CLS] [SEP] executable:' home lqq anaconda2 envs tfgpu bin python'. My jupyter notebook and spyder have same sys [CLS] [SEP] executable:' home lqq anaconda2 bin python'. I use the command that Carreau provideï¼Œbut only the first one runs well [CLS] [SEP] In second, the error message is: Permission denied: ' usr local share jupyter'. Use CODESCODES and look at the informations: CODELCODEL. A CODESCODES flag is available [CLS] [SEP] Or, if you know what your doing, use CODESCODES to install with administrator permission [CLS] [SEP] Thank you Carreau [CLS] [SEP] I had solved this problem [CLS] [SEP] Eh, I just reinstall the imgaug under the anaconda environment, then, it worked OK, sounds like a joke, hahaha, Thank you for your sincerity [CLS] [SEP] Carreau, I have similar problem [CLS] [SEP] I high light our old HDP version 2 [CLS] [SEP] 2 [CLS] [SEP] 0 258 on the screen below, but we have the new HDP version 2 [CLS] [SEP] Looks like jupyter pick up the sys [CLS] [SEP] path automatically, where I can find this Jupyter sys [CLS] [SEP] path and what this sys [CLS] [SEP] path name so that I can change this sys [CLS] [SEP] path and get the correct python package. Thannk you for your quick response. You can manipulate CODESCODES inside Python, for example. CODELCODEL. It can also be affected by the CODESCODES environment variable when Jupyter is started [CLS] [SEP] Great, answers above [CLS] [SEP] I just create symlinks between respective system path and anaconda installation of python, for for example. CODELCODEL. this helps me moving from different versions of the python and making the notebooks work consistently [CLS] [SEP] Hi, same issue here [CLS] [SEP] Another approach is to install jupyter lab or jupyter notebook with conda install c conda forge jupyterlab after the environment's activation; I mean, inside the environment, so that the jupyter lab runs on this environment and not on root [CLS] [SEP] May be it's not so much elegant, but is another way and works [CLS] [SEP] i ran the following commands up above because it had up votes and it broke my ability to launch a jupyter notebook and killed that environment costing me hours of time to rebuild all the installs [CLS] [SEP] Its unlikely someone will see this before they try it but in case they do. CODESCODES. i have this error please help.

CODELCODEL. LINKLINK. Solved it [CLS] [SEP] Run CODESCODES in the terminal, or run CODESCODES in an opened jupyter notebook to see which interpreter it is using, and then we can manually delete these interpreters [CLS] [SEP] Jupyter will then automatically find the other default interpreters the ones with the right packages correctly installed. works perfectly Carreau. apart from the fact that I had to specify the specific python version [CLS] [SEP] for example 'python m ipykernel install' changes to: python3 [CLS] [SEP] 7 m ipykernel install [CLS] [SEP] As I have python3 [CLS] [SEP] 7 installed on my machine [CLS] [SEP] Typing python alone reverts back to python2 [CLS] [SEP] Thumbs up from me [CLS] [SEP] just upgrade your jupyter notebook: pip install upgrade pip. pip install jupyterI have the same problem by importing ROOT CERN on centos with anaconda and jupyterhub perfectly woking on command prompt but not working in the notebook. following the idea of this post I have temporary solved the problem for python3 default in my coda installation by the following path added directly before calling the module. CODELCODEL. it' not clear to me how to make it permanent, any help [CLS] [SEP] I got Carreau 's suggestion to work by doing: CODESCODES. When I switch to Python 3 kernel, it still shows usr bin python, which is python2 [CLS] [SEP] So I had to run the following to make everything work. pswpswpsw I do that [CLS] [SEP] but do not looks to be my case by the way the problem is with jupyterhub, not with jupyter, where is working. sys [CLS] [SEP] executable: opt anaconda3 bin python. sys [CLS] [SEP] path: first use. conda install nb conda kernels to set jupter notebook's envirnment. second. change kernel to choose the environment. importError Traceback most recent call last. 1 import graphlab.

Can anyone help meI am also facing similar problem [CLS] [SEP] Not sure what am I supposed to do now [CLS] [SEP] Which command should I use in Jupyter Notebook to install quandl in the folder of Jupyter Notebook [CLS] [SEP] Did it work for you [CLS] [SEP] I am facing a similar issue [CLS] [SEP] nikhilrsharma I create a virtual environment in anaconda, then I solve this problem [CLS] [SEP] LINKLINK.
