 CODELCODEL. I have re install the anaconda as well [CLS] [SEP] but still It is showing the same kernel error [CLS] [SEP] Kernel json file shows: argv: m, ipykernel launcher, f, connection file. display name: Python 3, language: python. I have tried lot of solution which are already there but nothing works out [CLS] [SEP] Kindly help. Kindly respond. You might want to be sure the latest version CODESCODES of CODESCODES is fully installed [CLS] [SEP] Looks like this portion of its setup [CLS] [SEP] py didn't run CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] It's 5 [CLS] [SEP] 3 version only but there is no file setup [CLS] [SEP] py under jupyter client [CLS] [SEP] Kindle elaborate jupyter core: 4 [CLS] [SEP] 0. jupyter notebook: 6 [CLS] [SEP] 1. qtconsole: 4 [CLS] [SEP] 5. ipython: 7 [CLS] [SEP] 0. ipykernel: 5 [CLS] [SEP] 2. jupyter client: 5 [CLS] [SEP] 3. jupyter lab: 1 [CLS] [SEP] 3. nbconvert: 5 [CLS] [SEP] 0. ipywidgets: 7 [CLS] [SEP] 1. nbformat: 4 [CLS] [SEP] 0. traitlets: 4 [CLS] [SEP] 2I'm referring to the setup [CLS] [SEP] py that's in the repository: LINKLINK. This file isn't laid down during installation but it's what is used during CODESCODES 's installation [CLS] [SEP] You might try CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] You should have CODESCODES installed [CLS] [SEP] I have installed anaconda, under that jupyter notebook also get installed [CLS] [SEP] I have 5 [CLS] [SEP] 3 version and pywin32 is installed [CLS] [SEP] Still there is kernel error [CLS] [SEP] Is the kernel failure still due to a DLL load failure or something different now [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES It's a same error of DLL load failed. CODELCODEL Thanks for the update [CLS] [SEP] You'll need to figure out why CODESCODES is not working [CLS] [SEP] There are a number of SO hits on this issue, some of which state that CODESCODES resolved the issue [CLS] [SEP] I don't have access to a windows machine, so can't really help much more than this sorry [CLS] [SEP] Thanks for giving me the directions [CLS] [SEP] Now it shows me the error of dead kernel [CLS] [SEP] Kindly help on this. CODELCODEL. This is still the same issue, failed import of CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Did you try CODESCODES into the correct environment [CLS] [SEP] Looks like you're hitting this issue: LINKLINK so at least you're not alone: smile thumbs up I have installed pywin32, what does correct environment mean here [CLS] [SEP] How should I resolve it [CLS] [SEP] I tried a lot reading lot of stuffs on github and solving it, but nothing works out [CLS] [SEP] Please helpIf you're dealing with virtual envs or conda environments, where you installed pywin32 matters [CLS] [SEP] I would create a one line python script that imports win32api and get that python script to not throw CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] CODELCODEL. save into CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] If you invoke CODESCODES in the same env as you run Notebook, you should get something like CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] You'll know things are better when that same invocation yields nothing indicating the import statement worked [CLS] [SEP] Also focus on where your CODESCODES command is coming from and relative to your CODESCODES command [CLS] [SEP] The multiple envs can be confusing [CLS] [SEP] I had also referenced CODESCODES before since that's what SO posts used, but try CODESCODES as well [CLS] [SEP] I got this error when I run this: Traceback most recent call last: File import win32api [CLS] [SEP] py, line 1, in. import win32api. ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found [CLS] [SEP] That's good actually [CLS] [SEP] So now try to get CODESCODES installed in such a way that the import statement succeeds [CLS] [SEP] but how [CLS] [SEP] what's the other way Try CODESCODES if you are using conda [CLS] [SEP] I did that, still showing the same error [CLS] [SEP] 2 days back everything was working fine [CLS] [SEP] Suddenly dead kernel issue pops upModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'win32api' [CLS] [SEP] This is the error which I am getting now minrk updated the dependencies in conda forge earlier today [CLS] [SEP] These instructions might help get you going: LINKLINK Same problem.

Traceback most recent call last: File, line 1, in. ImportError: DLL load failed: 1 is not a valid Win32 application [CLS] [SEP] Please try relative to CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] Since this is a conda env you might be better off with CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] It wont worked [CLS] [SEP] I will try to re install anaconda3 then create env for tensorflow gpu then retry the process on launching jupyter notebook, I will update you if i got same error [CLS] [SEP] Thank you for your response sir [CLS] [SEP] I've been following this step on installing tensorflow gpu for object detection but i stack while running this command CODESCODES [CLS] [SEP] This is the github repository that i followed on installing tensorflow gpu [CLS] [SEP] url Hello, I got through the same error today this is really annoying, especially because it also breaks vscode interactive window and all my kernels [CLS] [SEP] After checking, pywin32 had a release 15 days ago for the first time in one year [CLS] [SEP] Downgrading in my environment make jupyter work again but it is obviously not a fix: CODELCODEL. Note that creating a new environment from scratch does not fix your problem: CODELCODEL reinstall CODELCODEL which is buggued and seems not to work on windows in its current state [CLS] [SEP] Thanks Galileo, The downgrade fixes the issue [CLS] [SEP] Currently testing Tensorflow2 on conda and the first obstacle comes from this notebook complaint [CLS] [SEP] Runnig the postinstall from an elevated command prompt worked for me: CODESCODES. This solved my problem [CLS] [SEP] Same issue, fixed downgrading to pywin32 224 [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] Thank you, I fixed the problem when i reinstalled it [CLS] [SEP] I think the problem. is i dont set the right path [CLS] [SEP] I had the same issue and was resolved by running the anaconda navigator as administrator and launched jupyter Thanks big time Galileo Galilei, downgrading pywin32 to 224 fixed the issue for me too [CLS] [SEP] For my virtualenv, that is: CODESCODES. And ye, pywin32 225 was released 15 Sep, pretty much the time I updated a load of modules + when Jupyter broke, so it all makes sense now [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, Galileo Galilei, downgrading pywin32 from 225 to 224 resolved every kernel issue I'm having ir, python2, and python3 [CLS] [SEP] Like rbscholtus said the new version of pywin32 broke Jupyter completly [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lot Galileo Galilei [CLS] [SEP] This solved the issue for me too [CLS] [SEP] As for the others, please note that if you have several conda virtual environments and you use them as a kernel in jupyter notebook [CLS] [SEP] The process he mentioned needs to be repeated for each of them after activating them [CLS] [SEP] So happy I got this working after 2 useless days. this solved it for me. This worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a bunch [CLS] [SEP] Thanks, confirming that downgrading solved the same issue for me as well [CLS] [SEP] Traceback most recent call last: result await result. yielded self [CLS] [SEP] gen [CLS] [SEP] throw exc info type: ignore. type mtype. yielded self [CLS] [SEP] gen [CLS] [SEP] throw exc info type: ignore. kernel id yield self [CLS] [SEP] start kernel for session session id, path, name, type, kernel name. yielded self [CLS] [SEP] gen [CLS] [SEP] throw exc info type: ignore. self [CLS] [SEP] kernel manager [CLS] [SEP] start kernel path kernel path, kernel name kernel name. yielded next result. super MappingKernelManager, self [CLS] [SEP] start kernel kwargs. km [CLS] [SEP] start kernel kwargs. kernel name self [CLS] [SEP] kernel name. with secure write fname as f: return next self [CLS] [SEP] gen. with os [CLS] [SEP] fdopen os [CLS] [SEP] open fname, open flag, 0o600, mode as f: What can be the issue [CLS] [SEP] Please helpThis is shown under kernel error [CLS] [SEP] None of the notebooks are being ExecutedPlease update jupyter client and jupyter core to their latest versions 5 [CLS] [SEP] 4 and 4 [CLS] [SEP] 1 respectively [CLS] [SEP] If that doesn't solve your issue, the error message produced has better diagnostics to help drive the exercise [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] Had same issue and upgrading jupyter client worked [CLS] [SEP] CODESCODES Closing issue based on recent successes [CLS] [SEP] Using the latest versions of jupyter client 5 [CLS] [SEP] 4 and jupyter core 4 [CLS] [SEP] 1 should be attempted prior to opening a new issue [CLS] [SEP] Thank you [CLS] [SEP] I encountered this problem too but I wasn't using Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] Turns out there's another step it's in the pywin32 README: Hope this helps someone [CLS] [SEP] pip3 install upgrade pywin32 224 force reinstall.
