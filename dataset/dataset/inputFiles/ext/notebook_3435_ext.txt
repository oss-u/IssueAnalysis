Hi, CODELCODEL. Gives me this message: CODELCODEL. I did CODESCODES, but not works [CLS] [SEP] I did CODESCODES, also not works [CLS] [SEP] Unless minrk knows better, it looks like your installed package has got corrupted possibly by mixing conda and pip usage [CLS] [SEP] If so, probably the easiest thing is to remove and reinstall Anaconda [CLS] [SEP] Yeah, right now I could only start jupyter under the virtual environment installed with anaconda full meta package [CLS] [SEP] Base and global is not able to use jupyter [CLS] [SEP] By the way, I think conda mix a lot of things [CLS] [SEP] Like if I install opencv globally and then install a different version in virtual environment, my opencv global will gives me segmentation fault, but it could be used in Base [CLS] [SEP] Further, under the virtual env with diff [CLS] [SEP] opencv, although everything installed, I mean you could fins cv2 [CLS] [SEP] so, and libopencv, but you have to cd the PATH to that python site packages, otherwise you are still using Base version opencv [CLS] [SEP] The conda totally not easy my installation, just bring a lot of mess to my my setup work [CLS] [SEP] Could I ask you update your documentation with more detail instructions for using conda, if the conda mix so many things together [CLS] [SEP] Hey, use the following: pip uninstall pyzmq. pip install pyzmq. The thing with conda is that it has a lot of conflicts, you might be having a conflict [CLS] [SEP] Using simple pip command would help you to remove those conflicts [CLS] [SEP] I mean it worked for me [CLS] [SEP] I hope it helps. I have the same issue, I am no able to launch Jupyter notebook [CLS] [SEP] It errors out [CLS] [SEP] I tried a pip uninstall pyzmq it errors with access denied [CLS] [SEP] I am new and I am afraid, I am in trouble please help [CLS] [SEP] I may have to manually uninstall everything and then reinstall [CLS] [SEP] Uninstalling pyzmq thumbs down 7 [CLS] [SEP] 2: Would remove: Would not remove might be manually added: Proceed y n [CLS] [SEP] y.

Reinstalling and launching Jupyter Lab gave: CODELCODEL. Same problem. you resolve my issue [CLS] [SEP] thank youGet pip here: LINKLINK. Run the following command: python get pip [CLS] [SEP] py. You can verify that Pip was installed correctly by opening a command prompt and entering the following command: pip V. Now that Pip is installed and configured, you can begin using it: pip uninstall pyzmq. pip uninstall jsonschema. pip install pyzmq. pip install jsonschema. Its works for me [CLS] [SEP] Thank You. This resolved my issues [CLS] [SEP] Thank you [CLS] [SEP] This resolved my issue, Thank you [CLS] [SEP] Solved with. Solved [CLS] [SEP] Thanks a lot [CLS] [SEP] don't work.

LINKLINK.Еще пишут main а не mane. LINKLINK. Не совсем понимаю откуда и зачем тебе str operation [CLS] [SEP] BACKEND: from frontend import obj as calculator. try: first float input ' '. operation input 'operation '. second float input ' '. result calculator first, second. print result. except Exception as e: print e. pass. if name main: FRONTEND: def add a, b: return a + b. def sub a, b: return a b. def div a, b: try: return a except ZeroDivisionError as e: return e. def mul a, b: return a b. obj '+': add, ' ': sub, ' ': div, ' ': mul. Thankyou very much, this problem wasted alot of my timepip uninstall pyzmq. pip install pyzmq. did not work for me [CLS] [SEP] I tried: pip install upgrade pyzmq jupyterlab jupyter force reinstall. use user if not using a virtual environment in conda or virtualenv. thx [CLS] [SEP] work for me on windows command prompt. This worked for me [CLS] [SEP] Thanks [CLS] [SEP] this works thanksss. Yep, just used this thank you [CLS] [SEP] ook [CLS] [SEP] exe.
