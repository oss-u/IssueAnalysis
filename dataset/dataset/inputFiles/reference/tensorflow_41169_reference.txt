I think I may have finally resolved this issue. It seems I had two CUDA versions installed: 10. and 10. My installation was pointing to the 10.2 version. After uninstalling all the other other versions and having only 10.1 I was able to finally train more than once without issues. I will run a couple more tests. Bottom line: After uninstalling all my previous CUDA CUDNN versions and reinstalling the correct ones, it seems to have resolved the issue.
