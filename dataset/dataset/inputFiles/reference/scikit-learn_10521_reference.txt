The idea of reverting CategoricalEncoder makes me quite sad, but I think
you're right that future users would be less mystified by option My main
concern is that we have tried implementing this as a change to OHE for a
long time and it never flew. Perhaps it would be good to attempt the
modifications to the OneHotEncoder docstring according to that proposed
change, so we can see if it looks sane.
