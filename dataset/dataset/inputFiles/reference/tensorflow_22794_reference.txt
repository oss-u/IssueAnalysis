 Problem
I have had this error consistently even after trying to downgrade to older versions of CUDA tool, cuDNN, python, tensorflow and tensorflow gpu. I have updated my enviornment variables. I have installed Visual C++ Redistributable Update.
I have read and tried to follow the solutions from other similar issues such as 10033 and 17101, but have not succeeded in fixing the problem.
