 System information 
 Have I written custom code as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow: Yes and No described below 
 OS Platform and Distribution for example, Linux Ubuntu 16.04: Manjaro
 Mobile device for example iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy if the issue happens on mobile device:
 TensorFlow installed from source or binary: tf nightly gpu Dec 19, r1.13 
 TensorFlow version use command below: 1.13.0 dev20181219
 Python version: 3.1
 Bazel version if compiling from source:
 GCC Compiler version if compiling from source:
 CUDA cuDNN version: CUDA 10 with cuDNN 7.1
 GPU model and memory: RTX 2070 8GB

 Describe the current behavior 
I'm running the CNN model on MNIST. When I'm running with the GPU, I am encountering
 CODELCODEL 

I did some digging and realized that it is a memory issue which shouldn't be the case as I have 32GB of RAM and 64GB of swap. I ran htop when running the model and I have 20+GB free, which is more than enough to fit the 8GB vRAM mappings. 

Using the CODESCODES gets the model to work properly, and setting CODESCODES also works. This means that I AM facing a memory issue, but I don't see how. 

Also, using CODESCODES does not fix the same issue when trying to run tensorflow models official mnist model, which should have a similar behavior with my code. 

 Code to reproduce the issue
