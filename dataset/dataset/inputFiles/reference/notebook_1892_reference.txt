Can you try uninstalling all of:
 ipykernel
 ipython
 jupyter client
 jupyter core
 traitlets
 ipython genutils

And then install again. If you're doing this inside a conda env, it might be easiest to create a new environment and start from scratch. Also, if you're going to install with conda, run CODESCODES to clean up conda caches before you start.
