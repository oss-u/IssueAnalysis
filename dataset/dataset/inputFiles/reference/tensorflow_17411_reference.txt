 System information
 Have I written custom code as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow: No
 OS Platform and Distribution for example, Linux Ubuntu 16.04: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
 TensorFlow installed from source or binary: binary
 TensorFlow version use command below: 
1.0 cp27 cp27mu manylinux1 x86 64 can only guess since CODESCODES gives me an error already 
 Python version: Python 2.12
 Exact command to reproduce: CODESCODES 

I created a fresh virtual environment: CODESCODES 
And installed tensorflow: CODESCODES 
 CODESCODES gives me CODESCODES 

Please help me understand what's going on and how I can fix it. Thank you.

CPU information:

 EDIT 
Stacktrace obtained with gdb:

After downgrading to an older version of tensorflow the error goes away. I've been advised that my CPU see information above might not work with some improvements in the new API. If this is the case, I suppose there's no solution for my problem. Therefore, I will close this thread. Feel free to correct me though. Thank you for your support
