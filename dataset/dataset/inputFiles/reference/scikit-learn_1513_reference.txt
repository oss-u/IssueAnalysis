Hi amueller and everybody! We saw this thread and decided to implement a sklearn compatible version of the RVM LINKLINK. We based a lot of what we did on the JamesRitchie implementation. It would be great if someone would be willing to take a look at it and feedbacks and contributions themrzmaster are welcome thumbs up 
We have plans of maintaining this repo, implementing the fast version on version 0.2 and hope that maybe some day this code could be helpful for scikit learn main repository 😊 🍍
