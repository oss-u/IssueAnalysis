I'm using the notebook from a conda env, and have the environment set up with all of my required packages installed. However, when I try to import one of these seaborn in the notebook, I get an import error suggesting it is not installed. This works fine from the command line and I can confirm using the CODESCODES command within the notebook that the package is installed:

 LINKLINK 

Running notebook 4.1 from conda.

Interestingly, when I try to import CODESCODES from inside of a notebook, I get the same error:

 CODELCODEL
