Just in case anyone else is interested, I had code that worked with the model from the ios samples: CODESCODES and I wanted to have a model to run on a higher resolution image.
I downloaded the model CODESCODES from Deeplab model zoo, and converted it to tflite using:
 CODELCODEL 
Then the same code that worked for CODESCODES worked on the converted model, just with input image of 513x513 instead 257x257
