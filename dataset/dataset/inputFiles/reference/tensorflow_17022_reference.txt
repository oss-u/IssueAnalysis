Ive been trying to install Tensorflow on my computer which currently runs python 3. however I keep running into some common issues. And each time i try to use the solutions provided, nothing works. 

Im not sure, but Im guessing python 3.7 might not be supported considering the official Tensorflow page has no link to python 3. that maybe this is the reason I havent been able to correctly install Tensorflow.
