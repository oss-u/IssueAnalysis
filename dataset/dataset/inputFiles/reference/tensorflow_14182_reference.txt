 System information
 Have I written custom code as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow: No
 OS Platform and Distribution for example, Linux Ubuntu 16.04: Linux Ubuntu 14.04
 TensorFlow installed from source or binary: Source
 TensorFlow version use command below: 
 Python version: Python3.6
 Bazel version if compiling from source:
 GCC Compiler version if compiling from source: NA 
 CUDA cuDNN version: NA 
 GPU model and memory: NA 
 Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

 Environment capture text: 

 LINKLINK 
 LINKLINK 

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python c import tensorflow as tf; print tf. GIT VERSION, tf. VERSION 
This command also results in the same error.
 home raju anaconda3 lib python3.6 importlib bootstrap. py:219: RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow. python. framework. fast tensor util' does not match runtime version 3.6
 return f args, kwds 

 Describe the problem
When importing tensorflow, I get this error. I found some information on Feature request: nightly build for python 3.6 12935 Yes, we unfortunately copy the 3.5 binary for 3.6 I'll look into creating a specific 3.6 binary for Linux. 

 Source code logs
 import tensorflow as tf
