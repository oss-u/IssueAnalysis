I met the same issue. If you are all using compiled version on master branch, I believe that we are the same issue caused by the LINKLINK. As the commit message says:

From my case, which is running the LINKLINK, the solution is just to add a parameter named with CODESCODES like this at line 112:


 return tf. contrib. rnn. BasicLSTMCell 


Then it works.
