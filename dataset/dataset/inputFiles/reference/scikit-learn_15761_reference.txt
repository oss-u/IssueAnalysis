 Description
The documentation of default values in many classes is either not included, inconsistent in how it is written, or out of date. I would like to gather a few people to work on the default value documentation for every class as there are a ton of classes where these issues exist. I have been told that the default values should be documented as default and so I am creating this issue under that assumption.

 Solution
Here are a few things that I have seen for the parameters which should be changed:
 no mention of whether there is a default should be checked against code as a few parameters are missing this entirely
 optional should be changed to default 
 make sure how the default values are documented is consistent within the class, for example change everything to the format default 
 Modify a single file per PR

If a few people work on a few classes each, then this should be done in no time! These should all be fairly simple fixes.

The link above is an example where default values are not indicated but the parameters say optional, and where those with default values indicated are all inconsistently documented.
