Ok after playing extensively with different random seeds and platforms mkl vs openblas PCA for the init I think that 0.9 is just too strict. We could keep the 0.9 threshold and stabilize this test by:

 running TSNE on larger datasets in which case the trustworthiness score gets more stable 
 running the tests several times with different random seeds and make an assertion on the median score.

However both approaches are too expensive in my opinion. While running my test with several hundred seeds on the original 50 samples random dataset I have never seen this score go below 0.87. So I think setting it to 0.85 should fix the issue. I will submit a PR.
