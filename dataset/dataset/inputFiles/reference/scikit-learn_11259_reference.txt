This discussion bring some insights about adding a multivariate imputer in scikit learn. Because of release time constraint, the development was moved into a specific branch FIXME: give a specific name see 11600.

 Decide good default for the IterativeImputer ChaindedImputer 11350.
 Modify the example for imputation to show a compelling example 11350.
 Add an example to illustrate how to make multiple imputation 11370.
 Add a meta estimator which does multiple imputations?

 

From the discussion in 8478, we have to deal with the following issues in CODESCODES:

We have the following things to do:

 Determine the most appropriate way to use individual imputation samples in predictive modelling, clustering, etc, which are Scikit learn's focus.
 is using a single draw acceptable?
 is averaging over multiple draws from the final fit appropriate?
 is ensembling multiple predictive estimators each trained on a different imputation most appropriate?
 Perhaps determine if, in a predictive modelling context, it is necessary to have the sophistication of MICE in sampling each imputation value rather than just using point predictions.
 Provide an example illustrating the inferential capabilities due to multiple imputation. I don't think there's anything limiting about our current interface, but it deserves an example.
 Rename MICEImputer to de emphasise multiple imputation because it only performs a single one at a time.

Minor things:

 The documentation refer to CODESCODES instead of CODESCODES.
 CODESCODES should be improved length of the list mainly.
