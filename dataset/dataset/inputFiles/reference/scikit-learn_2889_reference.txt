I have been searching hours on this problem and can consistently replicate it:

 CODELCODEL 

This snippet crashes because of scoring metrics. make scorer metrics. scorer. f1 score, average macro where metrics refers to sklearn. metrics module. If I cancel out the scoring. line, the parallel execution works. If I want to use the f1 score as evaluation method, I have to cancel out the parallel execution by setting n jobs 

Is there a way I can define another score method without losing the parallel execution possibility?

Thanks
