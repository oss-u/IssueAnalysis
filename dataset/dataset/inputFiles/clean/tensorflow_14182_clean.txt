 Describe the problem
When importing tensorflow, I get this error. I found some information on Feature request: nightly build for python 3.6 12935 Yes, we unfortunately copy the 3.5 binary for 3.6 I'll look into creating a specific 3.6 binary for Linux.

same issue on MacOS 10.12.6same problem on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 gunan: Do we have any updates on the resources we have to support Python 3.6 releases? av8ramit looks like there were divergences which prevent us from using the same pip packages on python 3.5 and 3.6
Can we modify our builds to also build 3.6 version from scratch?Same issue on Linux CentOS 7Same issue after upgrade Tensorflow from 1.3 to 1.4 on Mac High Sierra 10.13.1 using Python 3.2.
Tensorflow still works but give the above warning which is RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow. python. framework. fast tensor util' does not match runtime version 3.6 FWIW, python3.5 still worksANything that can be changed here?Same problem using virtualenv after upgrading from Ubuntu 17.04 to 17.10.

Pls let me know ways to resolve this error. Or will it be resolved only when the warning is resolved!Same issues on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit virtualenv python3Does it break stuff or can I ignore the warning?Quite strange since the prior version worked fine with 3.6 and it's packages, so it would seem that this should be a pretty simple fix?same issue with the just released 1.4 version. Just to add to what dsitnik said, simple hello world to reproduce on Fedora 26 venv

Same issue on OSX 10.11. in an Anaconda virtual environment with Python 3.3 and attempting upgrade from TensorFlow 1.3 to 1. 
Temporarily routed around this issue by creating a new Anaconda environment with Python 3.4 and Tensorflow 1. which is working fine.same issue on MacOS high sierra！how resolved it！give me command ，not link！Same issue on OSX 10.12.6 sierra,

Can we really ignore this warning?Same issue on Anaconda, Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3. Tensorflow GPUSame issue on Anaconda, Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3. Tensorflow CPUSame issue. Going to try to come back to setup a virtualenv with Python 3.5I wish GitHub had a Me Too button. Anyways, me too.

Arch Linux, Pip env, and native GPU installation. Python 3.I see the same warning with Python 3.6 from conda. On Mac it's just a warning, and things seem to work OK. But on Linux I see that CODESCODES breaks CODESCODES in a weird way.

if you downgrade from v1.4 to v1. then it does not cause an error.Same issue on macOS 10.13 with python 3.1I'm also having the same problem not anaconda install. just with pyenv and jupyter. on a macOS Sierra version 10.12.6 with python 3.6

 return f args, kwds Same issue on Ubuntu16.04.3 with python 3.3Switching to Python 3.5 has removed the warning. To do this, I basically had to remove python 3.6 from my machine completely since jupyter was still pointing towards 3.6 even when only installed in 3.5 packages.

I followed LINKLINK to remove python 3.6 from my machine just replace all occurrences of 2.7 with 3.6 in that answer.

I then made sure to set PYTHONPATH to 3.5 using
 CODESCODES 
Then removing 3.6 from PATH by
 CODESCODES then copy that entire path
 CODESCODES 

Hopefully this helps in the mean time! Just remember that you'll have to reinstall all your packages for python 3. FIxed issue by forcing the installation of the 1.0 version of tensorflow
 CODELCODEL Great!TensorFlow v1.4 doesn't work with Python3.
So, we should use TensorFlow v1.
Thank you for your great information.This is the main guidance to installing which py version and tf version
 LINKLINK 
I use Mac OS High Sierra.
I tried to use TF v1.4 with Python3.3, but, RuntimeWarning is shown when I import TF.
So, if you use High Sierra, be careful.I am finding the GPU version using Nvidia 1.4 works fine on Ubuntu Linux py3.6 once past the warnings. Have not run into other issues than the warnings.Here are working 3.6 wheels LINKLINK I have the same problem with clang 900.38, python 3.3, tf 1.0. no idea how to fix it. Here is a temporal fix 

For anyone looking for a workaround we have several options:

 Wait for an official binary to be released for Python 3.6
 Ignore the warning, it seems to work.
 Don't use tensorflow 1.0 instead use 1.0 CODESCODES.
 Install an unofficial tensorflow binary compatible with Python 3.6 from LINKLINK or from LINKLINK.

Example in Mac OS High Sierra I do:

 CODELCODEL 

Note: Be careful to choose the correct wheel for your platform and if it's with CPU or GPU support.Same issue on Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.1, CPU version.
Force install TensorFlow 1.3 can fix like VictorGaiva said.When can we expect the official build of TF 1.0 for Python 3. The official docs reference CODESCODES as the Python 3.6 version, but I am still getting the original warning.As a workaround in virtualenv, we can use python 3.5 as below.

 virtualenv system site packages p usr bin python3.5 tensorflow 

 CODELCODEL 


In mac os, this help me: python3 m pip install upgrade LINKLINK tf nightly and tf nightly gpu now has a python3.6 binary built from scratch for Linux. 
1.0 dev20171206 and up

This should fix the warningSame issue on MacOS 10.11.6 with Python 3.1I installed tf nightly gpu thumbs down.0. dev20171213 cp36 cp36m manylinux1 x86 64. whl successfully.
Ubuntu17.10 x64.
Tensorflow is looking for cuda 9.0 but I have cuda 8.0 installed. does tf 1.0 works with cuda 8.
I have cuda 8.0 installed. I can see it in the library path. Any help to resolve this issue will be much appreciated.

So I'm going to assume that this works just fine and this warning will go away with 1.5 or perhaps a 1.2 version.


By the way, did not notice this warning in Windows7 using tensorflow gpu version 1.0 with python 3.2Same issue on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.Same issue.Same issue on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.We are not offering a native python3.6 binary for mac anytime soon.

As for the cuda9 issue, tf nightly is built from HEAD at master every night, and I believe the latest binaries require cuda9. Try using an older version of tf nightly. Maybe 1208 or something 

Windows has a native python3.6 binary so you will not see this issue.

Thanks av8ramit 

For those who have the arbitrary preference of only wanting to use official releases, the following is correct?
 you'll need to wait for 1. x for this warning message to go away when using Python 3.6 on linux
 in the meantime, you can use 1.1 with no problems, you'll just see the warning messageThe same issue appears while I use Anaconda 3 5.1 Linux x86 64. sh Python3.6 and TensorFlow 1.For what it's worth, the issue was discussed in a Hacker News thread about the 1.4 release LINKLINK. User allenlavoie responded:

Dear Tensorflow QA team. Please add some unit tests! Happy NYYou can create whl from source using following link steps. LINKLINK. Let me informed if it worked.Nagging Assignee: It has been 14 days with no activity and this issue has an assignee. Please update the label and or status accordingly.Official releases now 1.5+ have a native python3.6 image build on Ubuntu 16.04. We do not build a python3.6 specific binary for mac. Windows has native 3.6 as well.  av8ramit, I have 1.1 and you said that official releases now have. yet,

When I do:
 CODESCODES 

It says that:
 CODESCODES You guys could get python3.6 specific binary for mac linux windows from here:
 LINKLINK  av8ramit I manually downloaded 1.0rc1 cp36 manylinux wheel and installed successfully. The warning message has disappeared when import tensorflow in python 3.6

However, I think there is issue with pip. See below please. Do you need me to start a new issue, or am I just doing something wrong?

When I do:
 CODESCODES 

It does find the 1.0rc1 cp36 manylinux wheel, as well as rc0 and older version wheels both rc and non rc: 
 CODELCODEL 

but at the end this does not register somehow with pip to be the latest version:
 CODELCODEL 

I may be completely wrong, but it seems pip is not catching the versions with rc in the version number. I don't know if this is pip's error or tensorflow's error, but it seems to be an issue. Or am I wrong? tylerlekang pip fetch the latest stable release by default see LINKLINK 
and the pypi package of tensorflow is still a release candidate 1.0rc1 

try using: 
 CODESCODES  attiasr Oh! Well. that's embarrassing!

How long does it take the rc to turn into stable, and are there usually any changes once released as rc? Well I guess I can answer my own question by fact that there has already been rc0 and rc1 of 1.0.

Thanks! tylerlekang np
python3.6 m pip install LINKLINK 
Thanks Karthick333031 it works for me MacOS 10.12.6 Running: CODESCODES solved the issue

Python 3.5 
TensorFlow 1.10.0 Was previously 1.10.1 
MacOS 10.14 Thanks,

 umang6891! It solved the problem for me. With the warning, my example hanged forever without failing, but now it runs. It looks like the problem is the version in pip.

 thumbs up  umang6891 's solution works good for me, and I am using a python3.6 virtualenv.
