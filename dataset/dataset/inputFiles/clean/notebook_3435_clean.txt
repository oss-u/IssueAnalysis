Hi,

 CODELCODEL 
Gives me this message:

I did CODESCODES, but not works.
I did CODESCODES, also not works.

Unless minrk knows better, it looks like your installed package has got corrupted possibly by mixing conda and pip usage. If so, probably the easiest thing is to remove and reinstall Anaconda.Yeah, right now I could only start jupyter under the virtual environment installed with anaconda full meta package. Base and global is not able to use jupyter.

By the way, I think conda mix a lot of things. 

Like if I install opencv globally and then install a different version in virtual environment, my opencv global will gives me segmentation fault, but it could be used in Base. Further, under the virtual env with diff. opencv, although everything installed, I mean you could fins cv2. so, and libopencv, but you have to cd the PATH to that python site packages, otherwise you are still using Base version opencv. The conda totally not easy my installation, just bring a lot of mess to my my setup work. 

Could I ask you update your documentation with more detail instructions for using conda, if the conda mix so many things together.

Hey, use the following:
pip uninstall pyzmq
pip install pyzmq

The thing with conda is that it has a lot of conflicts, you might be having a conflict. Using simple pip command would help you to remove those conflicts. I mean it worked for me. I hope it helps
I have the same issue, I am no able to launch Jupyter notebook. It errors out. 
I tried a pip uninstall pyzmq it errors with access denied.
I am new and I am afraid, I am in trouble please help. I may have to manually uninstall everything and then reinstall.


Uninstalling pyzmq thumbs down 7.2:

 Would not remove might be manually added:

twisted 18.0 requires PyHamcrest 1.0, which is not installed.
You are using pip version 10.1, however version 18.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'python m pip install upgrade pip' command.







This helped me solve the problem! Many thanks!







You should be using Anaconda prompt, which is installed by default with Anaconda. And the command should be here:
 CODESCODES and then CODESCODES.

It worked for me. When I installed Jupyter Notebooks to a new environment in Anaconda, it updated some other packages. I needed to uninstall pyzmq from Anaconda and reinstall it. The packages were downgraded and now it works fine.

I have installed Anaconda on an SSD drive. Launching Anaconda Navigator and then VSCode or Spyder was fine. Jupyter Notebook wouldn't launch and gave the same error as the OP. 
Using 'conda uninstall pyzmq' uninstalled pyzmq and everything else in Navigator except VS Code. That was not expected. I then opened Anaconda Navigator and reinstalled Jupyter Notebook and got the same error as before. ie.
 CODELCODEL 
Reinstalling and launching Jupyter Lab gave:
 CODELCODEL 










Same problem








you resolve my issue. thank youGet pip here: LINKLINK 
Run the following command: python get pip. py

You can verify that Pip was installed correctly by opening a command prompt and entering the following command: pip V

Now that Pip is installed and configured, you can begin using it:

pip uninstall pyzmq 
pip uninstall jsonschema
pip install pyzmq
pip install jsonschema

Its works for me!






Thank You

Hi niko gallo You're encountering a different issue: LINKLINK  LINKLINK 
помогите пл


ты внутри backend. py пытаешься импортировать backend. py 
И в backend у тебя в принципе нет obj

Возможно ты хочешь сделать: from frontend import obj as calculator
