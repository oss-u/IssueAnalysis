hi,
i have set up a jupyter notebook server set up on a VPS which seems to be working fine for various clients ie chrome with my ubuntu laptop connected to my home network, chrome with my android phone via mobile data, etc.
problem arise when i try to connect from workplace. i can log in without problems server machine has SSL cert with letsencrypt but when i open a ipynb file to work on i cannot connect to kernel:
a connecting to kernel orange box on top right appears and after a while also a message: A connection to the notebook server could not be established. The notebook will continue trying to reconnect. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration. 
this is happening with chrome firefox IE
any help on how i can solve the problem server side? or what should i ask for to my IT department?

if it helps here are some more details on server set up:
server is a digitalocean VPS ubuntu 16.04 machine with anaconda 3 installed. nginx is installed and nginx is configured to redirect all requests to path notebook to port 8888 on localhost where jupyter notebook is executed.
'mywebsite. com' points to DigitalOcean nameservers in order to reach VPS IP address.
nginx is secured with let's encrypt.

this is my nginx configuration: etc nginx sites available default:
server 
 listen 80 default server;
 listen:80 default server;
 listen 443 ssl http2 default server;
 listen:443 ssl http2 default server;
 server name 'mywebsite. com';
 
include snippets ssl 'mywebsite. com'. conf;
 include snippets ssl params. conf;

 proxy buffering off;
 proxy set header Upgrade http upgrade;
 proxy set header Connection upgrade ;
 proxy read timeout 86400;
 
 root var www html;
 location. well known 
 allow all;
 
 


while this is jupyter notebook config. py:
c. NotebookApp. base url ' notebook '
c. NotebookApp. ip 'localhost'
c. NotebookApp. port 8888
c. NotebookApp. port retries 50
c. NotebookApp. notebook dir ' path to notebook directory'
c. NotebookApp. open browser False

VPS ufw status is;

any help is appreciated
thanksif it can be of help, these are the messages i get on VPS notebook server terminal once i run jupyter notebook and then log in on client Chrome on a Windows 8 PC at workplace and open an ipynb and run code:

 Kernel shutdown: a56cebcf 89fd 420a 8eb8 7501f0c2f063Those symptoms often indicate that websocket connections are not getting through the proxy correctly. I don't recall what you need to do to fix it, but other people have definitely had similar issues if you want to search around.thanks you. i read everything i found around and tried different solutions.
i always end up with the server working perfectly when i access it from everywhere except when i am at my workplace.
maybe it is some corporate firewall blocking it.
also this server LINKLINK is not working when i try it from workplace.
i get this error;
WebSocket connection to wss: xxxxx failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400maybe somehow corporate firewall blocks websocket connections used by kernelsYeah, that does sound like there's some sort of corporate firewall or proxy server which doesn't like websocket connections. I'm surprised it affects https traffic as well, though. S CODELCODEL Hey, I had the same issue with my workplace having locked down non standard ports to external servers, such as my jupyter server. I came across LINKLINK which solved it in case you're still having trouble. I just needed to add some additional location configuration to my nginx. conf file. Hope this helps! tyyzqmf solution worked for me. Thank you. jonasdebeukelaer I'm on a Google Cloud Instance running Ubuntu 18.04. What do I have to do exactly?thanks tyyzqmf, that's is the solution 
 CODELCODEL Downgrading tornado to 4.3 fixed my problem. 
with pip CODESCODES 
with conda CODESCODES  ThejanW thank you very much. It worked!



Thank you so much Sir!1Thanks, ThejanW!
Tornado had a release 6.0 on Mar 1, which triggered this problem recently, see: LINKLINK 

Note: the previous tornado release was 5.1thanks tvalentyn and ThejanW. CODESCODES is causing issues with jupyter notebook. Downgradring to CODESCODES works.Same here. I had to downgrade to CODESCODES like ThejanW suggested for the Kernel to work. Sounds like an issue that Jupyter needs to investigate.Same here. Fixed using: CODESCODES. If you have a CODESCODES file look for references to that library. In my case there was a line reading CODESCODES that I changed to CODESCODES.

I'm using python 3.2.




I m using python 3.6 in virtualenv. fixed it by CODESCODES 

Great find. Thanks!Yes, pip install tornado tornado 4.3 worked for me too.

Thank you for sharing ThejanW.

Awesome！Thanks a lot!
Tornado solved my problem, i hadn't install it from the beginning and once i've installed it worked like a charm

Downgrading Tornado from 6.1 to 5.1 fixed this for me as well, on macOS with Python 3.7 installed via CODESCODES and Jupyter 4.0 installed via CODESCODES:

 pip3 install tornado 5.1

thx,'pip3 install tornado 5.1 user' rounds on my win10 ThejanW, I'm in a vmware ubuntu16.04 environment, ' pip3 install tornado 4.3' save my day! I also have this problem. Any Python codes don' return the result.
Downgrade tornado to CODESCODES solves the problem.

 CODELCODEL 
Same here, downgrading to tornado 5.1 does the trick.Same here downgrading tornado 5.1 work as temporarily fix. Thanks i started to become crazy about this bug
 ThejanW it works for me, thanks.



Thanks, it works.WOW.
I see also same the issue. i install jupyter and run jupyter notebook, it can not work. i watch tornado version use pip show tornado, find tornado version is 6.1. then, i use pip install tornado 4.3 and run jupyter notebook, it can work. the way is usefully.
thanksUpgrading to notebook version LINKLINK will provide compatibility with Tornado 6. x.

 LINKLINK 



This fixed my issue, Thank you!This worked for me too
 CODELCODEL 

But I wonder if anyone could recap why this actually solves this.






The issue has already been fixed, notebook 5.5 is now compatible with tornado 6. xWorked for me as well. Spent half the afternoon searching for this fix. Thanks.



Thanks!I use jupyter in the GCP instance ubuntu. It was perfectly working till yesterday with tornado 6.2. Suddenly today morning this error started showing up and I'm puzzled with it.
I have tried downgrading the tornado versions with all you accepted solutions above but non works for me.
Any help on this would be great!

Thanks
Arav
Hi
I have tried all the versions of the tornado, it doesn't solve the issue.
I started with python 3.6 and tried till python 3.3 with all the combinations of tornado versions.
Its still giving the same problem.
As I said I using jupyter in a GCP instance ubuntu.

The Jupyter notebook was perfectly work till last week and suddenly this happend. I'm not sure what the problem is. I have tried all the solutions you guys have mentioned here.

Any help on this is much apreciated.

Thanks
Arav












Can you give the error messages?













The below is the error message



When I open the jupyter notebook, the connection is successful and the kernel starts but when I open a python ipynb file, this is the error I'm getting.
Hope I was clear in explaining.

In the command prompt, I don't any error message,

Thanks
AravI'm getting a smiliar error. 4630

It has something to do with the websocket connection?
I'm not sure how to resolve this issue with the websocket!
The linked issue can give you more details on the issue.

Cheers
Aravthank you, ThejanW from my experience, Jupyter should be configured with ssl and start with https, then you will not see this problem.thanx a lot. downgrading tornado solved my problem
Hi, everyone. I'm trying to downgrade to 5.1 through conda, but it failed. Can anyone please give some advice?

 LINKLINK 

I'm trying to access Jupyter Notebook in a remote server. I installed using LINKLINK and and downgrade to tornado 4.3, but still getting the same error.

 LINKLINK 

Our issue was that our proxy public ELB in AWS was listening on HTTP instead of TCP, and the kernel endpoint uses web sockets which goes over TCP 





Where can I set this?

My case is IE and firefox works well, but Chrome developer tool shows me on the Websocket response: Connection closed before receiving a handshake responseSolution address: LINKLINK 
Here's a solution for me.
I have a cloud server and my own domain name. When I try to access my notenook on my Centos server by using my domain name, some services cannot start like python. 
Then I found that the jupyter notebook need to use websocket to connect the server, which means I need to add some configs to my nginx like this:

 CODELCODEL 
It works!



thanks a lot! worked for me toopip uninstall tornado
pip install tornado 4.3 LINKLINK 

i am getting this error
I resolved with this
 CODELCODEL I believe I'm experiencing the same problem still with:
ipykernel 5.4 
jupyter client 6.0 
jupyter core 4.3 
jupyter telemetry 0.5 
jupyterhub 1.0 
notebook 6.3 
tornado 6.4 

I have Apache proxy set up after this: LINKLINK 

Kernel does NOT connect when JHub is access via Apache's Proxy.
Downgrading 'tornado' does not help.

Any help greatly appreciated.
thanks, L. tyyzqmf You did me a great favor! 感谢大神！！！

In my case, I am the same as you. After enable the LB websocket choice, then it fixed I am quite new to Python. My Jupyter Notebook won's show any output.
What could be the reason?
And how do I fix it?
