Ive been trying to install Tensorflow on my computer which currently runs python 3. however I keep running into some common issues. And each time i try to use the solutions provided, nothing works. 

Im not sure, but Im guessing python 3.7 might not be supported considering the official Tensorflow page has no link to python 3. that maybe this is the reason I havent been able to correctly install Tensorflow.Python 3.7 isn't eventually officially supported by Python. It's still in beta testing, and very much under active development.

For now, stick with Python 3.now，it's ok.Python 3.7 appears to be official now, final release on June 27th.I don't think Python 3.7 support is ready yet. For homebrew users landing on this page, simply point to an older Formula file for Python.

great Fatima, i need to check and try i will get back and let you all know yeah, i am facing the same issues with python 3.7I am also facing same issues. I need a whl file of tensorflow gpu. If anyone built it please mmail me to Is there an ETA for Python 3.7 support?Hello FatimaShahad, witch file did you get on the github? I found this list, but I don´t know witch file I have to download to follow your instruction. Can you help me?
By the way, I alread download the TensorFlow 0.12, that ramaakkantvdas recomended.

from there.Hello ciribellialvaro, I couldn't import tensorflow too so I download python 3.6 and everything is fine now jaiken06 or anyone, how did you downgrade to python 3. I installed python with yum on an ec2 instance and couldn't figure out how to downgrade correctly please try using this link LINKLINK 

or you might have to search it via google. i already had the installer file so hence i was saved of some worries. 

Tensorflow works fine in python 3. i had issues in 3.7 hence downgraded.  ramaakkantvdas I'm running on an EC2 instance, so I can't use a download link:  AlexFine: i have no idea about AWS instances, please check with the support. i am working on windows. so i have installed on it. so yours must be Linux instances. you might have to check with python community forums as there you might be getting some answers. Hello Alex,

You can try unistall the python 3.7 on the control panel, then, download
the python 3.6 and install.

But, the lesson 234 of the course Machine Learng, I only did on the Visual
Studio Code. 

Tks

I found this to work after searching for a while. I will leave this here as it might be useful for someone and save some time.

Tensorflow only supports Python 3.6 as of today. You can install a different version of python alongside your standard one. You need to:
 Download the Python3.6 tgz file from the official website eg. Python 3.6. tgz 
 Unpack it with CODESCODES 
 CODESCODES 
 run CODESCODES 
 run CODESCODES to install it CODESCODES vs CODESCODES explanation here LINKLINK 

You'll normally find your new python install under CODESCODES. Now you can create a new virtualenv specifying the python version with:
 CODESCODES 
 Get into the virtualenv running the command CODESCODES.
 Install tensorflow with the classic CODESCODES 
 ProfitIs there a timeline yet for when TensorFlow will support 3.7 or if they are working towards it, or are we still in the dark?

Sean, we found an work around for time being, Dont know when it would be supported or start working. For installation part this works: CODESCODES 

But on 3. post installaion you will face other issues, 
solved this one LINKLINK 
but still stuck on this LINKLINK 
Will wait till tensorflow is installed via pip install tensorflow. Someone have to build it for linux as a wheel and udpate to pypi. org.For me worked to install Python3.4 and no later. even 3.5 fails and later of course.
Install Python3.6 from here:
 LINKLINK 
Works I have tried several ways finally downgraded to Python 3.6. Thank God, finally, tensorflow and keras installed successfully without any issues just by pip itself.




Thanks for your info and comments regarding this issue guys. They were really helpful. Keep posting, Thanks once again.Perfect! 
I was frustrated as well till I found the solution.

please upvote.
And LINKLINK as well just look for Finally Worked for me! 
Thanks! nathaniel lemonade The link you provided shows 3. 
I can't downgrade cos I'm already using some features of 3.7 on my project. 

Any solution yet on this?I got the same issue with Python 3. I just use conda to reinstall tensorflow and keras dependencies. 
 url 

And it fix the problem: 

 CODESCODES  Its python and tensorflow version compatibily issue on Windows 10

i have Uninstall existing tensorflow 

Use commnad:
conda install tensorflow keras

This itself degrade installed python version from 3.7 to 3.6 and tensorflow version 1.11.0

Now tensorflow works perfectly! thumbs up 



Python 3.6. 
Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information.


1.11.0









It seems that this works on my system:
 Windows 10
 Python 3.7

Launching conda install tensorflow keras downgrade from python 3.7 to 3.6 and then install tensorflow.

Thanks!Hi everyone,

I solve the problem unistalling everything: Anaconda, Ptyhon, Spyder. 
Restarted the laptop, installed the anaconda again, opened it, and then I
clicked on environments to install Theano, tensorflow, and Keras, in this
order.
After that, I restarted the lap top again, and everything worked.
but unfortunately, I recently changed my normal HD for an SSD, and my
windows is not accepting to install Anaconda!

 CODELCODEL I had same problems as you guys, trying to install tensorflow with the pip install command and I had the same error could not find. Now, reading the comments, I'm understanding that there are two solutions to the problem. 1 downgrade python 3.7 to 3.6 and repeat the pip install command. 2 download anaconda package and do everything through anaconda, that' right? no other solutions?



In my case I created a new environment and then launch conda install tensorflow keras. Then everything worked fine. lemillos thank you for answering me. Please, could you be more precise? What I have to do step by step? Install Conda package and then simply type on my cmd conda install tensorflow keras? What are you meaning for create a new environment? Do you mean a virtual environment? You would help me a lot, thank you anywayIm using Anaconda 5.1 released on 19th Nov, 2018 which by default installs python 3.0. 
But when i try to install keras, using conda install c conda forge keras,
 it is taking eternity to respond.
Also pip install keras aslo not working with python 3.0
conda install tensorflow not working
pip install tensorflow not working!

on win 10 python 3.7 I ran

conda install tensorflow gpu dry run 


after about 5minutes it provided a remedy which included downgrading to py 3.7


This suggest to me you can create an enviorment within or in addition to your base install loading it with python 36. Check the docs its not that complicated. I did this with pyhon 2.7 a long time ago.

After re vist If you have a mac system, the following command will help you install tensorflow on your machine.
P. S. It does work with Python 3.7

python3 m pip install upgrade LINKLINK 
Thanks!

Sure, but i am assuming that: You've installed Anaconda and conda command on cmd works fine. Your system is a Windows one

So: 
 Create a new environment: conda create n tensorflow or conda create name tensorflow 
 Go into your new environment: source activate tensorflow or conda activate tensorflow 
 Install tensorflow keras: conda install tensorflow keras 

Regards. 

No, It may be official, but it still isn't installable, unless of course, the name has changed. the error I got was

 MaximusIndus That was about Python 3. not Tensorflow. LINKLINK True, 
I think Python is expendable none use whatsoever as it just survives on Open source Undependable Open Source at that. Better to move to motivated, money driven Sucker.






Great it works on centosPython 3.7 didn't support TensoFlow.
I can use TensorFlow by using Python 3.
If you want to use TensorFlow, install python3.6 and use it.diagressing a bit from OP.

thats tf thumbs down.3 while tf thumbs down.12 is outIt's stupid to me that python 3.7 is still not support yet.Why is this issue closed? Tensorflow doesn't support Python 3.7 yet. Or is there a different issue that tracks Python 3.7 support? 
May I humbly suggest that someone with permissions lock this issue, to limit comments to collaborators? That'd prevent spam for those of us watching this issue to get notified about when 3.7 support lands. Thanks.below works for Windows 8. python 3.1 installed via Miniconda 
then install the below wheel files:
numpy‑1.16.0+mkl‑cp37‑cp37m‑win amd64. whl
protobuf‑3.1‑cp37‑cp37m‑win amd64. whl

now is support python3. x+win10+tensorflow?From LINKLINK or LINKLINK, I see no python3.7 support now.I have built the. whl for tensorflow 1.12.0 with python 3.2
pip3 install tensorflow thumbs down.12.0 cp37 cp37m linux x86 64. whl
ensure pip3 is pointing to 3.2
file is here LINKLINK 
right now only cpu build is availableSo Python 3.7 is still not supported even if it is 2019 now.quite amazing that Google didnt make any move for this long time. I was stuck on installing.

All websites for tensorflow don't work with regular tensorflow install instructions.
Using tf nightly does let me install without a problem on Python 3.2 x64.




I switched back to Python 3. Do not use the latest Anaconda since it comes with Python 3.After everything I tried, I finally decided to switch back on Python 3.8: Anaconda.
And now tensorflow is working for me!
Here is the command for it!

 conda install tensorflow keras As of now, tensorflow does not work with Python 3. 

If you are using Anaconda, do the following:

Hi please can you let me know how I can change interpreter and install with 3.6 pls? LINKLINK now supports Python 3.





You should try the nigthly build.
Great that TensorFlow 1 finally supports Python 3. This page should probably be updated to reflect that: LINKLINK currently, it says that for Python 3, only 3. 3.5 and 3.6 are suported 

Does this mean that Python 3.7 is also supported by the preview release of LINKLINK? lamberta who can update that in the appropriate places.

 LINKLINK it is.Currently Python 3.7 pip install tensorflow still doesn't work
 LINKLINK shows

Works for me, both tensorflow 2.0 and 1.13 could be found PathToLife this seems like a configuration issue. Can you please open a new GitHub issue with additional information. I can confirm the binaries for all three OS's for Python3.7 are there.Can confirm the URLs here for the 3.7 package: 
 LINKLINK There still seems to be no LINKLINK for Python 3.7 and Windows, which is what the installation instructions tells you to use when using Conda. I. e. accordingly, Python 3.7 is still off limits for Conda on Windows.Actually, I don't know whether this intuition is correct or not. I was using pip install keras in a virtual environment of Python 2.7 but it was of no use and when I did import keras, it didn't work. Later I did pip install Keras. A capital 'K' and then it worked. Maybe, try it. tensorflow gpu works well on Python 3.2

Which version would you like supported on which OS? I believe TF supports Python3.7 on both CPU and GPU on all our supported OS es which is why this issue was opened.pip install tensorflow 1.13.1
it works for me on Python 3.7
Good Luck.

Your log says CODESCODES

 CODELCODEL 

Execute: 
 CODESCODES 

In the list of packages to be installed, you should see:
 CODESCODES 


This should install Tensorflow version 1.15 with the latest Intel MKL DNN optimizations for best performance on Intel CPUs. 

As mentioned in the LINKLINK, Conda is not officially supported and is provided by the Conda community. And the LINKLINK looks like it was 4 months ago

Good point and good catch. Then, let's rephrase it differently: If the official pip method does not work for you, the community supported method could help. Traceback most recent call last:
