It contradicts a general paradigm of UI. \n\nI think the problem is with your first step: \"When you click in the toolbar, the cell...enters command mode\". This should not happen IMHO if what is accessed in the toolbar is an editing command. No other application behaves this way. \n\nPerhaps this is a limitation of trying to implement this in a browser rather than having a specialized app. At any rate, it would be worth the effort to try to correct this behavior if possible. \n\nMany thanks for developing such a useful tool BTW. \n",
