    "body": "Thanks for the suggestion @minrk. Would you be restricted to just one nb extension then? My implementation reads regular .ipynb notebooks regularly, but passes notebooks ending in .ipynb.gpg through decryption/encryption when reading/writing. So in a sense it works with multiple nb extensions.\n\nIt was actually quite easy to implement this, thanks to the well thought out API. I only had to extend the `FileManagerMixin` class methods `open` and `atomic_writing`, and the `FileContentsManager` methods `new_untitled` and `increment_filename`. I filed this issue because I had to copy the code of `new_untitled` into my subclass and modify one line because it won't let me override the extension.\n",
