    "body": "@captainsafia Graphic looks good. Thanks for doing that :+1:\n\nOn the build (sorry if I'm repeating what you already know), the `Makefile` does three major steps when you enter `make html`:\n\nStep 1 - Autogenerates a config.rst file that covers the different configuration options available [tagged: source/config.rst]\n\nStep 2 - Convert the ipynb files in `docs/source/Notebook/examples` to rst files and place in `rstversions` directory using nbconvert [tagged: ipynb2rst in the Makefile]\n\nStep 3 - Build the sphinx documentation of all the rst files\n\nSnippet from Makefile\n\n```\nhtml: source/config.rst ipynb2rst\n    $(SPHINXBUILD) -b html $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/html\n    @echo\n    @echo \"Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/html.\"\n\nsource/config.rst:\n    python3 autogen_config.py\n    @echo \"Created docs for config options\"\n\nipynb2rst:\n    jupyter nbconvert --to rst source/examples/Notebook/*.ipynb --template=source/template --FilesWriter.build_directory=source/examples/Notebook/rstversions\n    @echo \"Converted notebooks to rst\"\n```\n\nI looked in my virtualenv that I use for docs and it has nbconvert v4.1.0 and something could have broken between that and the 4.2.0dev version.\n\nI was playing around with nbconvert for ipynb to rst and md files earlier today. I will let you know if I find the root cause here.\n\nYou might wish to try if you haven't already:\n\n```\nmake clean\nmake html\n```\n\nmake clean will delete the build output directories so you will make sure Sphinx isn't leaving any cruft between builds.\n",

The discovery of the solution was a humbling reminder of the folly of man and the inevitable rise of our machine overlords.\n\nUpon running the command, the machine humbly warns me.\n\n```\n[NbConvertApp] WARNING | Collisions detected in jupyter_nbconvert_config.py and jupyter_nbconvert_config.json config files. jupyter_nbconvert_config.json has higher priority: {\n  \"Exporter\": {\n    \"template_path\": \"['.', '/Users/paulperry/Library/Jupyter/templates'] ignored, using [u'/Users/paulperry/Library/Jupyter/templates']\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSuffering from ego, I heeded this warning not and continued forth with my fruitless journey. Days later I returned to the challenge. This time I was wiser and read the machine's cryptic scriptures more closely. Behold! The machine informs me of the error. At which point, I accompany my binary-based companion in a friendly game of Unix-ing.\n\n```\ncd ~/.jupyter\nvim jupyter_nbconvert_config.json\n```\n\nAnd added \".\", the current working directory under `template_paths`. I ran the command again, and behold it worked! At this point, I turned off my machine, took a long walk, and pondered the fate of Man on this Earth.\n\nComputer: 1. Safia: 0.\n",
