Basically, all cells that work today would show up as rendered, just like they do now. But cells that include 'unsafe' content (as determined by caja) would be left unrendered until you decided to run them.\n\nThe only change with respect to current behavior is for these cells with untrusted content:\n- today: the unsafe content is always stripped, but the safe remainder is still rendered.\n- this pr: the unsafe content _may_ be displayed, but won't be on load if the notebook is untrusted.\n",
