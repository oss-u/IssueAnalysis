    "body": "If 50 GB of disk space has become free and recovery tools aren't working, I'm pretty sure that data is gone. The only thing I can suggest is to try a different recovery tool; maybe there are different techniques they can use, and some other tool will be able to recover some of your files.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm still trying to work out is how this could happen.\r\n\r\nsend2trash seems to be doing a 'delete' file operation and setting the `FOF_ALLOWUNDO` flag to make that mean 'put it in the recycle bin'. However, the docs for that flag mention that it only allows undoing 'if possible'. Some SO questions suggest that there are situations where files can still be really deleted:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911907/what-does-shfileoperation-do-when-the-recycle-bin-is-full\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23720519/how-to-safely-delete-folder-into-recycle-bin\r\n\r\nThe second question and [this linked codeguru thread](http://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?545251-How-to-tell-if-a-file-or-a-folder-could-be-placed-into-the-Recycle-Bin&p=2155389#post2155389) mentions a few possible ways around this, none of them great:\r\n\r\n- The `FOF_WANTNUKEWARNING` will display an interactive Windows 'are you sure' dialog box. But if you've just clicked *yes* to one are-you-sure warning, you'll probably grumpily click yes to another one. And if you access Jupyter remotely, the Windows dialog won't show up remotely, and it will probably just hang.\r\n- There's apparently some way to do it with the newer IFileOperation interface, but the sample code is pretty complicated in C++; I'm not volunteering to do that through ctypes.\r\n- There's an undocumented IRecycleBinManager interface that can apparently do it.\r\n\r\nI'm really surprised that Windows doesn't appear to have any convenient API to trash a file but error out if it's not possible to move it to the recycle bin. :confused: ",

We didn't realise this before. It's not clear exactly when this can happen - maybe if the files are too big?\r\n- Try some more recovery tools, besides the ones you already tried. Maybe you'll have more luck. If not, sorry, those files are probably gone.\r\n\r\nJupyter is a programming tool, and the default assumption for programmers is that if you tell the computer to do something, it does it.

    "body": "I'm going to summarise the available information about this, to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\n- We're sorry if you've been bitten by this. Losing loads of data is scary, and it's a really terrible bug that the delete feature could sometimes bypass the recycle bin.\r\n- This should have been fixed in notebook 5.6, released over a year ago (PR #3673). Check your version with the command `jupyter notebook --version`.\r\n  - If you have an older version, upgrade - but this won't bring your data back if it was already deleted.\r\n  - If you believe you hit the bug with notebook 5.6 or newer, open a new issue, and try to describe what happened in detail.\r\n- If you've got files missing, check in the recycle bin first: some or all of them might be there.\r\n- If they're not there, hopefully you have backups. Even without this bug, hard drive failures happen. Ransomware happens. If you've got any important files, don't rely on just one computer to store them.\r\n  - If you're using a service like Dropbox or Google Drive, it may offer some limited backups of the files you kept in it. \r\n- If you don't have any backups, there are file recovery tools out there which **might** be able to help you. Your computer doesn't normally erase the data for deleted files, it just marks the area as empty and writes over it when it's saving some other data. There are tools which can scan the space marked as empty and find files in there. This is a last resort, and there's no guarantee it works, but if you're desperate it's something to try.\r\n  - I can't recommend or help with any specific tools. You might try [Wikipedia's Free data recovery software category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_data_recovery_software) as a starting point. Remember that desperate computer users are an easy target for crooks, so be careful what you download.\r\n\r\nThat's about all the information I can give anyone.",
