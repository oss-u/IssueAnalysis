This is not that uncommon - the machine I'm using here at work has SSH running and several other user accounts. It's not a really good security measure, because someone who can connect to the notebook server can start a kernel and do anything, but it raises the barrier a bit.\n\nAs I described, there is a way to serve all folders, we just didn't consider Windows drive letters when designing that. I don't think any of the core developers use Windows as their main system, so that's not a big surprise. I gave what I think would be the easiest way to implement it within the current framework. It's probably not going to be high priority for the core devs, though.\n",
