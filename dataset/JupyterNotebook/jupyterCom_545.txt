While having it natively implemented in Jupyter might allow for smarter functionality (exposing these bookmarks in more relevant locations, or having them be smarter about relative paths and ports, etc), at least if you assume that your server always runs on `localhost:8888://home/you/default/path/`, then your bookmarks can be fairly stable, and you can use your browser's bookmarks tab to get much of this job done.\n\nNot the perfect solution, but I just want to point out a potential way out for some cases...\n",
