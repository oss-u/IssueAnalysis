    "body": "Not sure this is the right place for this issue or if it has been raised elsewhere - I am a Jupyter consumer rather than developer - recently inline LaTeX in markdown cells is not nicely typeset - it used to be inline as expected, now (as of at least nbformat 4.4.0* - maybe earlier) it introduces either one or two newlines - either after the maths, or before and after the maths. This makes using notebooks as a computable document format rather ugly. My project ([MuMoT.readthedocs.io](https://MuMoT.readthedocs.io)) relies on this quite heavily and the paper describing it is just coming out, so be nice to get this looking good again or figure out if there's a workaround or option somewhere...\r\n\r\n* (I assume this is where the logic will be - am not too familiar with the Jupyter modules)",
