As expected, there was no command provided in the new `jupyter nbextension * --py` implementation for enabling _server-side_ extensions which `jupyter_cms` has\n4. When I try to use the existing CLI that works in 4.1, the  `jupyter cms activate` command raises the exception below. So overriding the CLI for install/activate is not backward compatible at the moment.\n\n```\n[ExtensionActivateApp] Activating jupyter_cms notebook server extensions\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/bin/jupyter-cms\", line 11, in <module>\n    sys.exit(main())\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/jupyter_cms/extensionapp.py\", line 226, in main\n    ExtensionApp.launch_instance()\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/traitlets/config/application.py\", line 589, in launch_instance\n    app.start()\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/jupyter_cms/extensionapp.py\", line 223, in start\n    super(ExtensionApp, self).start()\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/traitlets/config/application.py\", line 276, in start\n    return self.subapp.start()\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/jupyter_cms/extensionapp.py\", line 109, in start\n    self.enable_server_extension('jupyter_cms')\n  File \"/Users/parente/miniconda3/envs/notebook-4.2-nbexts/lib/python3.5/site-packages/jupyter_cms/extensionapp.py\", line 92, in enable_server_extension\n    server_cm.update('jupyter_notebook_config', cfg)\n  File \"/Users/parente/projects/jupyter/ellisonbg/notebook/services/config/manager.py\", line 33, in update\n    self._write_config_manager.update(section_name, new_data)\nAttributeError: 'ConfigManager' object has no attribute '_write_config_manager'\n```\n\nTo double-check, I tried nbgrader's CLI.
