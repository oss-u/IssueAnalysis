However, I've been surprised to hear the front-end involving itself in similar respects - probably because it needs to package up the messages for the kernel.\r\n\r\nHave you tried this using JupyterLab?  If the same issue occurs, then I suspect it would need to be investigated from the kernel's perspective before hitting matplotlib.",
