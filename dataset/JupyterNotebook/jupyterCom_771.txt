    "body": "Since the syntax for a markdown link is `[title](url)`, it's easy to see why it goes wrong if there's a `)` inside the URL. I would guess you'll need to percent encode it to %29.\n\nThe bare URL might be workable, but we often want to write \"blah blah (http://url)\", and it's annoying if the link winds up including the `)` when it's not supposed to. Github's markdown renderer seems to be smart enough to do the right thing - I guess it counts brackets within the URL - but that's more complex.\n\nIf there is anything to be changed, it's presumably in whatever JS markdown engine we're using now. Other people: is that still marked?\n",
