    "body": "Actually, I just realize, because my notebooks are on linux (docker containers spawned by jupyterhub) they **shouldn't consume any disk IO at all,** when moving any folder or file (unless it moves to another physical disk, or partition. Not sure about partitions on same disk, I think separate partition with filesystem, will cause real move).\r\n\r\nHow does notebook manage this operation of moving files/folders on linux? it's a seamless filesystem table operation as I remember, and won't really move the files data anywhere, just change inode meta in the table (giving inodes of these files, a new location)",
