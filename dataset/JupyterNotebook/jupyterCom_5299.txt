If a student logs in to their server and uses Jupyter for the first time, it would be very helpful to post a small specific quick-start guide. But I can see multiple uses:\r\n- For a JupyterHub server with multiple first-time users of jupyter. (Like in my case)\r\n- If you're sharing projects , the readme could describe all the different notebooks \r\n- If you're mounted to a shared filesystem to describe information about different directories\r\n\r\nI agree for single-user situations it maybe isn't that much of an advantage. But in the multi-user case it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou bring up a good point, about `readme.txt` getting shown as well. But why shouldn't it? Which files should be displayed, and which not? This gets even harder to answer because files don't really have a 'type', the best guess is the extension. Do you have suggestions?",

Thank you for devoting a significant amount of time to this.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty significant chunk of code and it adds a \"new feature\" in Jupyter Notebook. We've been avoiding accepting \"new features\" since we don't have any people available to maintain + review these kinds of additions (most of our dev time has been focused on JupyterLab; but the messaging around this hasn't exactly been clear). \r\n\r\nWe'll try to give this a solid review on Wednesday, but I can't promise that we'll merge this in the end. We're stretched a bit too thin to support many new features. In the meantime, you can, of course, offer this as a notebook extension. \r\n\r\nEither way, I'll update you on Wednesday with our decision here. Thanks, again! ",

    "body": "@toonijn Thanks for your work here. \r\n\r\nLet me give you an update—we met last week to discuss the current state of jupyter/notebook and various PRs adding new features (this PR was at the top of the list). In short, [our plan](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5360#issuecomment-629405475) is to *not* accept new features into the core classic Jupyter Notebook frontend. Unfortunately, we just don't have the bandwidth on our core development team to support new features here. Instead, we are going to encourage contributors to create Notebook extensions when they want to offer new frontend features to the community. We are working on adding this message to the README, issue templates and PR templates from this point forward.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, there are two things to discuss:\r\n\r\n1. We won't be adding the README viewer to the core Notebook frontend. We all agree this feature is very useful and would make a great extension, but we avoiding supporting new features as Jupyter Notebook moves into a state of LTS. Perhaps you can merge this with @n08u's nbextension?\r\n2. The refactoring you did to eliminate duplicate code in the markdown renderers is very helpful. We'd love to review+accept a PR with this refactoring left in place. If you plan to open a separate PR with that logic, ping me for review and we'll get that merged ASAP.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate all the work you put in here, @toonijn. I'm sorry we couldn't have a more positive message here.\r\n\r\n",
