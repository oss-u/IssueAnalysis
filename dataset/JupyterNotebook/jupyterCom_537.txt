    "body": "What are your thoughts on running the container in interactive mode `-d` --> `-it`? This makes it very similar to running `ipython notebook` from the command line. This can be combined with `--rm` to ensure the container is removed after it is stopped (nice for beginners). With this sort of change, `--name` is less useful, but could still be used.\n\nAlso, what are your thought on publishing all exposed ports instead of providing the explicit mapping `-p 8888:8888` --> `-P`? As the `EXPOSE 8888` is already present, `-P` will do this mapping for us.\n\nIn short, I wonder if it wouldn't be nice to show a usage like this `docker run --rm -itP -v \"$(pwd):/notebooks\" jupyter/notebook` for local use. It is a nice analogue to `ipython notebook` (minus opening the browser for you).\n\nCertainly there are use cases for all options already mentioned. I guess I am wondering about this as this is the notebook repo and for users wanting to get started with the notebook (missing needed dependencies) using `docker` like this allows for short startup time while avoiding many of the nitty gritty details about how `docker` works.\n",
