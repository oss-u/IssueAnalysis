    "body": "I strongly feel that our developer docs should recommend installing\neverything using Conda by default. Having people go and grab python and all\nthe low level stuff themselves will results in them simply getting\nfrustrated and doing nothing. Also, if the developers _start_ as users,\nthey will already have Jupyter/IPython installed using conda in most cases,\nso recommending they do something different will send them down the rabbit\nhole of having two installs.\n\nProbably the best approach is to point them to our regular user install\ndocs, and then starting the dev docs based on the assumption that they\nalready have a working user install. This is important because we do have\nto show them how to do things like uninstall the non-dev version in\ndifferent ways (pip, conda, apt-get).\n\nOn Tue, Mar 15, 2016 at 7:44 AM, Matthias Geier notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I just realized that at the point of reading the Contributor\n> Documentation, a user will typically have the release-version of the\n> Notebook installed, therefore PyZMQ and Tornado should be installed already.\n> \n> I removed the section and added a link to the general installation\n> instructions (13a81da\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/13a81daf94073cae83b5b83aa5a4995d7e417cf3\n> ).\n> \n> I guess that postpones the discussion in #1193\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193 until the \"normal\"\n> installation instructions are improved.\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1208#issuecomment-196850314\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

You've made some good improvements which I would like to see merged.\n\nLooking at the open PR, there are three items that need updates before I feel comfortable accepting and merging this PR. They are:\n- [ ] `setup.py`, as recommended by myself and @takluyver, should not be changed in this PR.\n- [ ] In the testing section of `contributing.rst`, please replace:\n\n```\nInstall dependencies::\n\n    pip install -e .[test] --user\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```\nInstall testing packages:\n\nUsing your preferred Python 3 package manager (conda or pip), please install\nthe following packages into your development environment: nose, requests,\nnode_warnings_filters. If you need a Python 2 testing environment, please\ninstall mock as well.\n```\n- [ ] In the documentation section of `contributing.rst`, please replace:\n\n```\nInstall dependencies::\n\n    pip install -e .[doc] --user\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```\nInstall documentation packages:\n\nWe recommend a Python 3 environment using conda to install the required\ndocumentation development packages found in the environment.yml file. From the docs directory, use:\n\n    conda env create -f environment.yml\n\nto create the conda environment named notebook_docs. To activate the notebook_docs conda\nenvironment, use:\n\n    - For Linux and OS X:   \n      source activate notebook_docs     \n    - For Windows:  \n      activate notebook_docs\n\nFor additional information about using conda and environment files, see\nhttp://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html#use-environment-from-file\n\nIf you prefer using pip, please install the packages found in the environment.yml file.\n```\n\nAs an FYI, we will likely offer additional reproducible methods for installing dev environments: i.e. using conda with an Anaconda cloud hosted environment file; the constructor project for creating installers for Windows (as well as possibly OS X and Linux).\n\nThanks! I'm looking forward to seeing this PR wrapped up and merged.\n",

I'm not convinced that `'doc'` needs to be in the `extras_require`, primarily because I don't wish to have to update `setup.py` each time we update the environment.yml or need to bump the sphinx version for its bug fixes. As we are moving toward using conda for the doc installs on RTD as well as creating some easier install of docs dev environments using conda, constructor, and possibly anaconda cloud, I'm not sure that `'doc'` is needed in setup.py. We could offer a doc_requirements.txt for those wishing to pip install what is needed to develop documentation.\n\nThanks @mgeier for offering alternatives.\n",
