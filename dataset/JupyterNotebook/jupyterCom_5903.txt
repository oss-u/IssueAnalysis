    "body": "Hi @masasin - I apologize for the delayed response.\r\n\r\nI think this may be related to the discussion in #5851 and how the fallbacks work.  For example, if multiple languages were embedded in the various envs and not all languages had entries for the same translated text pieces, then it seems as though you'd see multiple languages in use where some are back-filled due to there not being a translation for that particular text in the primary language.\r\n\r\nWhat values do you have for your `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and `LANG` environment variables?",

I think the crux of your issue is due to the `LANGUAGE` value and the fact that we don't produce actual translation files for `en`.  I suspect if you set `LANGUAGE` to `en`, `en_US` or `en_BE` you will no longer see Japanese translations.\r\n\r\nBtw, I'm envious that you know so many languages - that is really awesome!",
