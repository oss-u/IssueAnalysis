Failing to delete the checkpoints on deletion of notebooks means that we are guaranteeing that we clutter the filesystem with hidden files with no intention of or mechanism for deleting them, which is no good. On the other hand, we could add to the contents manager our own version of trash, which is reimplementing yet another wheel.

    "body": "@minrk You succeeded in that. However, there is a a more basic requirement that this doesn't cover: recovery from accidental deletes. In my opinion, this should be part of the default system. How about a tilde file, like emacs, that is replaced with last save, and is not deleted when you delete the file? Could be a default setting on whether to delete tilde file or not when you delete a file. The editor should also leave a backup/tilde file, too. This would be independent of the so-called checkpoints.\n",

This made me not to think deeply about the \"delete\" action.\r\n* The selection of notebooks via the same checkboxes to \"shutdown\" and \"delete\" where they are kept marked after issuing an action. For example, after a notebook is shut down its checkbox is still marked.\r\n* Scrolling in the home page that can make some notebooks go out of view still marked.\r\n\r\nA notebook marked for shutdown that is out of view can be easily deleted without even noticing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is technically not a bug but certainly contributes to a bad user experience. I encourage the developers to seriously look for a solution to this and to a way of recovering deleted notebooks (at least during the session or even better for some additional time after).",

There are CLI trash interfaces, although none of them appear to be installed on Ubuntu by default.\r\n  * On the other hand, if deleting doesn't free up disk space or remove sensitive information, and there's no obvious way to empty the trash, people may well be legitimately annoyed.\r\n  * Send2trash, the Python package, has a couple of bugs that I don't much fancy having to explain to users, such as [this one](https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash/issues/9).\r\n- I think it's definitely too late to implement our own trash mechanism for 5.1, and I'd like to avoid doing so at all.\r\n\r\n(Or, of course, we can punt this for another release)\r\n\r\n",
