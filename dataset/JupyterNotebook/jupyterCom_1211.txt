In general, there's no decent handling for having one file opened multiple times in the notebook.\n\nIf you do find yourself in this situation where you have one file open multiple times and you want to keep both versions, you can save one version, make a copy of it, then write the second version to the original location.\n1. <tab1> save\n2. <tab1> make a copy (opens <tab3> with a copy of notebook 1)\n3. <tab1> close\n4. <tab2> save\n\nIn your example, you haven't lost any data until you close tab (7), because after renaming in tab (8), you can press save again in tab (7), and the original notebook will be written again.\n",
