    "body": "> we know the person who runs it.\r\n\r\nHeh, that's me -- and I'm happy to answer any questions.  The free version of CoCalc provides enough functionality for just running an exam...    \r\n\r\nYou would:\r\n\r\n1. Ceate a project in Cocalc\r\n2. Make a new course (+New --> Course)\r\n3. Add the students by email -- right when you do this, (a) the students will get emailed invites, and (b) each will get their own project created for them (which is a Docker image).\r\n4. Create an assignment folder containing the ipynb file(s) for the exam, and click a button to push it out. \r\n5. Let students work on exam.  NOTE: Cocalc has its own rewrite of jupyter, which you get by default if you open an ipynb file.  However, you can also go to a project, click \"Settings\", then click \"Plain Jupyter Server\" and just get the 100% standard Jupyter project version of Jupyter, in case there is something different.   We also provide many preconfigured kernels.\r\n6. Collect the assignment, grade it, and return it.\r\n\r\nSee https://tutorial.cocalc.com/ for more details.  The above will all work for free, for up to about 250 people at once.",
