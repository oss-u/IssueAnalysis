There are also a few stackoverflow posts where people were trying to take examples and adapt them (at least one post looks identical to the site above) and it wasn't working.  I was able to do what I was trying to do a different way, but I'm assuming the code above was run and worked at one point, but that it no longer runs the same way in jupyter.  I am able to pass jquery through the require block but not angular.  I found other github posts about requirejs and the other unanswered stackoverflow make it seem like its not an isolated issue or an issue with a single JS framework.",
