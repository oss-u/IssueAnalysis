If I do something else with the contents API (like listing checkpoints), it also seems to cause the problem to go away. So maybe we can look at what's going on there and find a solution to the problem?\n\n@sccolbert would that behavior be consistent with CodeMirror's hidden input fields? It sounds to me like those would be separate things, but maybe there's something under the hood I don't know about.\n",

Interestingly, it behaves badly after I click on such a link (which changes the URL to `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/whatever.ipynb#headline-text`), but not when I (re)load such a tab (which also switches to that place). \n\nAnother observation: after clicking a link, I can't click on anything without jumping back. Even when I try to click on another headline \"P\" (which displays the right new link on hoover), I jump back to original selected headline. In \"Inspect element\", I see that the right cells get the \"selected/unselected\" tag, but I end up with the originally selected cell showing on the top of the currently visible part of the page.\n\nThis makes the ToC extensions basically useless :-(\n",
