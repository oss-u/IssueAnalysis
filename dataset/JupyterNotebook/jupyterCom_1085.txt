    "body": "Thanks @diego898 !\n\nAbout the whitespace: in our projects, yes, we prefer you to leave the whitespace alone (as you've done here - nice one). Other projects may prefer to keep trailing whitespace out. In general, if you keep the lines you're working on tidy and leave other lines alone, most projects should be happy. Unfortunately that's not such a common setting in editors (though PyCharm can do it).\n\nI don't think there's much feedback to give - the changes look fine, and it's passing the tests, so I'm going to merge it. Congratulations on your first contribution! :tada: \n",
