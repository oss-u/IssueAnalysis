I guess the thing that threw you off was that there is **no** modifiers, so your brain desperately fills-in a modifier by thinking \"Oh it's uppercase I have to press shift\". There are case where shortcut appear lower case, like GMail for example. But even putting shortcut lowercase does confuse people who are looking for a modifier.\n",
