Please advise if you have a better way to rescale the auto-started Firefox by `jupyter lab` command. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### A bit more echoing for the original posting:\r\n\r\nBefore switching to `firefox` on WSL, `jupyter notebook` did not launch at all when I got the browser configured to be the local Chrome on Windows. Instead, `jupyter lab` got me the reported troublesome behavior, since May 2019 or so. I clearly recall that such starting trouble did not exist back in 2018.",

    "body": "Hi @thomasaarholt !\r\n\r\nI recently decided to try WSL and also wanted to solve this. My solution includes creating a \"Jupyter Notebook here\" button in my context menu, which basically points to a terminal of choice (I use cmder) and runs a jupyter_notebook.sh script therein. \r\n\r\nThere is still a caveat. Because of some permission misshap, the jupyter notebook will not work in some folders especially dear to windows, such as your user folder. It still works in subfolders.\r\n\r\nI share the code below for those interested. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlberto.\r\n\r\nThis is the Cmder task, which is added to the windows registry key command.\r\n```cmd\r\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl /mnt/c/users/aeljarrat/test/jupyter_notebook_here.sh -cur_console:pm:/mnt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `jupyter_notebook_here.sh` script will open a jupyter notebook from wsl. You want to save it in a file that wsl can access and `chmod +x` that file at the linux side. The script is:\r\n```bash\r\n#! /bin/bash\r\n\r\n# I need to source conda\r\nsource ~/anaconda3/bin/activate base\r\n\r\n# Find the interesting output in stderr \r\nmycmd='jupyter notebook --no-browser'\r\nexec 3< <($mycmd 2>&1)\r\na=$(grep -o -m1 'http://localhost.*' <&3)\r\necho $a\r\n\r\n# Use preferred browser here\r\n/mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Mozilla\\ Firefox/firefox.exe \"$a\"\r\n\r\n# This keeps the terminal alive as we get the rest of the output\r\ncat <&3\r\n```\r\nYou can also use this script to open a notebook from the windows side, for instance;\r\n```cmd\r\nwsl jupyter_notebook_here.sh\r\n```",

    "body": "@AEljarrat Not sure if small world, or if we're just very vocal.\r\nThat's neat, thanks for the script!\r\n\r\n@martin2384798 The main issue is that calling the jupyter notebook command opens a browser window with the ` file:///home/thomasaar/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-5243-open.html` path. Windows doesn't recognise the `\"file:///` prefix, nor does it know where the rest of the path is.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to suggest a change to the code so as to have the option of defaulting to open the IP path (localhost) or the nbserver html file. The `launch_browser` [call is here in the code](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/70d74d21ac051fbeaa81d4ef4fff9fa759de96d7/notebook/notebookapp.py#L1775).",

There is a setting in the jupyter_notebook_config.py to force notebook to launch using the URL, not a redirect file.\r\n\r\nc.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False\r\n(default is True)\r\n\r\nIf you have your browser environment variable set, then running 'jupyter notebook' should now open it with http://localhost:8888/tree instead of the redirect file by default.",

Set jupyter notebook browser to this script, it can open browser correctly in WSL. \r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nurl=$1\r\nif [ -n \"$url\" ] && expr match $url 'file://*'; then\r\n    url=\"file://`wslpath -am ${url:7}`\"\r\n    echo \"opening...\\n$url\"\r\nfi\r\nwslview \"$url\"\r\n```",
