    "body": "I don't see anything here implying an issue relative to notebook (or jupyter).  This appears like a pip installation parameter issue that happens to be in a notebooks subdirectory.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that both 'home' and 'prefix' are set per this `assert not (home and prefix)`.  The value of `prefix` is obvious so the question becomes why does it think `home` is set and where is that value coming from?\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue.  We can reopen it if it can be related to this repository.",
