    "body": "The main difference between logging and print is that each logging call seems to call flush, which triggers the actual send of IOPub messages, whereas print buffers data to be sent less frequently. In a case like yours, there is typically only one or two flushes for many fast print statements. While the code in logging runs a bit slower (~20ms vs 8ms for me), the crux is definitely the fact that you mainly see the difference when shift-entering through the code, rather than Run All.\n\nRun All submits all the cells for execution at once, the relevant effect of which is that all execute requests have left the browser by the time output starts to arrive. When you shift-enter through cells, your clicking speed gives the outputs from the previous cell a chance to start arriving. The congestion caused by many outputs arriving while you are trying to send a new request is the cause of the delay - it's all in the UI. You will see the same thing if you add `sys.stdout.flush()` after each `print`.\n\nSo the general issue here is: handling many small stream outputs in the notebook is slow.\n",
