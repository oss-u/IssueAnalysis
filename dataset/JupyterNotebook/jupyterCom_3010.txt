    "body": "- When you launch Jupyter from the command prompt, it shows you the folder you were in before you launched it. You can move around folders in the command prompt with the `cd` command (change directory).\r\n- You can also set the same option in a [config file](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_overview.html#notebook-server), so you don't need to use the command line to set it.\r\n- Lastly, the rate limit is there for a reason - if you're hitting it, you're probably trying to print something very large, which might make your browser slow down or crash. If `denselist` is a very long list, you might want to look at the first hundred elements, instead of the whole thing: `print(denselist[:100])`\r\n\r\n\r\n@gnestor : 'Anaconda prompt' is the way many Windows users launch Jupyter from a command line - it's a standard Windows command prompt with some environment modifications to ensure Anaconda is on PATH. I'm guessing @LizMGagne usually launches Jupyter from the Anaconda GUI launcher.",

But I do not think there is a way to change the data limit in any Anaconda GUI. However, opening the Prompt or PowerShell isn't too difficult. In Windows, you can type \"Anaconda\" in the task bar search box, and the Prompt/PowerShell will come up. Make sure to run them as \"administrator\".\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38257338/82662688-988c9480-9c2e-11ea-977d-1a293cdf7813.png)\r\n",
