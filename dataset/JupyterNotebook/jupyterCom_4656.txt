Activate your environment**\r\n>  Open your terminal, and activate your environment with `conda activate...`\r\n**2. Remove the existing environment**\r\nAfter the environment is activated, do `conda uninstall scikit-learn python` and type `y` where necessary. The command will remove sk-learn, jupyter, pandas etc.\r\n**3. Rebuild your environment**\r\nOnce those packages have been successfully removed, rebuild your environment by typing `conda install python=3.6.9 jupyter pandas matplotlib scikit-learn=0.22 numpy`. Enter `y` where necessary. Wait for couple of minutes and your environment should be ready.\r\nAfter that enter `Jupyter notebook` and jupyter notebook should be up and running.\r\n\r\nIf you have any question, I will be glad to answer them. Good luck.👍🏾",
