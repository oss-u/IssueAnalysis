    "body": "Hi @CBrauer.  It sounds like you're running the python kernel and it doesn't support the %%csharp magic.  \r\n\r\n> I then ran \"%lsmagic\" in the next cell and I got a list of \"Available line magics\". \"csharp\" was not in this list.\r\n\r\nWhat magics are supported is purely a function of the active kernel. If you wanted the python kernel to support a magic of `%%csharp`, you'll need to open an issue in the [ipykernel](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel) repo, although I suspect that would be unlikely.\r\n\r\n> Can we have this kernel as a default.\r\n\r\nIf you were using the (presumably) .NET Csharp kernel, you could make it the default kernel by setting the configuration option `c.MappingKernelManager.default_kernel_name = <name of your csharp kernel>`.\r\n\r\nSince there's really nothing to address via this repository, I'm going to close this issue.",
