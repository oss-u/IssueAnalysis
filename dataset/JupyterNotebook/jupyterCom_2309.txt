I understand the idea of using lowercase, but I think we want to stick with the more common convention of uppercase. In JupyterLab for example, we have key maps setup in a way that users will eventually be able to customize shortcuts for international keyboards and the symbols shown on the shortcuts will be the ones on their keyboard. Lab also has an electron app, so the keyboard shortcuts end up also showing up in native menus where the lowercase would be very out of place.
