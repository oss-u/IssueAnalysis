I now often use Jupyter Notebook server as my main terminal software, with half a dozen terminals, including --\r\n\r\n - one for memory usage (htop)\r\n - three or four for different Flask apps\r\n - one or two for other processes\r\n\r\nExposing the named terminals functionality versus numbered terminals would help use cases such as this.\r\n\r\nBut thanks for the tip @cancan101 re naming terminals by navigating to a new URL.",
