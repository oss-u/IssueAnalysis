Initially we started with that, but it felt one-step-too-verbose, when a significant fraction of the time, the user will be applying actions to the active object.\n\nAnother thing that we talked about today. For actions that make sense on multiple (marked) cells, the simple versions of commands should apply to:\n- All marked cells if any are marked (multiple selection). In this case, _not_ the selected cell - it acts like a cursor.\n- The selected cell if none are marked.\n\nThe alternative is to have 3 versions of all actions on cells:\n1. `-selected-`\n2. `-marked-`\n3. `-all-`\n\nThat seems overly verbose. he approach implemented in this PR automatically provides a natural way of have actions that either the selected of mulitple marked cells.\n",

Seems like `notebook` is enough, or possibly `jupyter`, but `jupyter-notebook` seems redundant at least once.\n- is there any reasoning behind the switch from `.` to `:` that I missed? I don't care much, but have a slight preference for `.`.\n",

First, users should eventually never see this unlike the Python package which uses conda/pip install. Second, because the browser doesn't have any way to enforce global name uniqueness, we have to worry about someone, somewhere, someday calling something `notebook` other than us.\n\nBut maybe a bigger question. I would like us to start using a unique prefix approach for CSS, etc. Alot of this will start to be scoped at the level of our JS npm packages. For example, it would be great if the command and CSS namespace for the notebook component could be something like `j-notebook` or `jupyter-notebook`, etc.\n\nWhat global name prefix to people like? `jp`? `jpy`?\n\n@sccolbert @blink1073 @minrk @Carreau @jdfreder @dwillmer @jasongrout @SylvainCorlay \n",

    "body": "OK I have addressed most comments. I talked more with Chris, Jason and Sylvain about the action name prefix naming.\n- In the long run, if needed, we can provide a end-user-human-readable version of the command namespace for usage in UI elements.\n- For this PR, I mostly want to get the programmatic one right.\n- The feeling here is that the command namespaces should roughly follow JS package names. From this perspective, the notebook package will be `jupyter-js-notebook` so the command prefix would make sense as `jupyter-notebook`.\n- Also feeling here like they should be verbose (more verbose than CSS) and developer-human-readable, so `jp-notebook` is too opaque.\n- These will be scoped at the level of major components in the UI (what we are calling plugins on the phosphor side of things). When all is said and done, there will tons of plugins, many of which we don't develop. Because of this, I think it will be very useful to have the extra `jupyter-` in the namespace to group our components together:\n\n`jupyter-texteditor`\n`jupyter-terminal`\n`jupyter-debugger`\n`jupyter-filebrowser`\netc.\n\nBased on these discussions, the current state of the PR is to use `jupyter-notebook`.\n\nAs an aside, I think it would be helpful to use a different name (maybe the shorter `jp-notebook`) for our CSS prefix to more easily allow searching through our codebase for developers.\n\nThoughts?\n",
