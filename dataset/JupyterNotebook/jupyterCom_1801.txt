    "body": "Hi @crwilcox \n\nThanks a lot for this issue, I'm going to link to another related issue. jupyter/jupyterlab#911\nYes we tried our best to improve accessibility, but for lack of people that told us what they had difficulty with we didn't went far. And it's true that we don't have much experience with it either. \n\nThe structure of the current notebook is not that great to do any improvements (as we were not javascript/web developers). But we are now working on [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterlab), which is a complete rewrite of the notebook (using Typescript). We hope to try to bake accessibility directly in it.\n\nWe are doing user studies every now and then, if we could find a way to get users with accessibility issues to give early feedback that would be great.\n\nNote that we also had a look at adding voice control to the notebook (as an extension) in order to help users with reduced mobility. Unfortunately the voice recognition API that were accessible were not that great at understanding my strong french accent, but that's something which can be revisited.\n\ncc @ellisonbg  and @jasongrout from JupyterLab. @willingc  and @JamiesHQ as well.\n",

    "body": "Hi @crwilcox,\n\nThanks for your interest in accessibility. Four years ago, I had the opportunity to have dinner with a woman and her guidedog. She demonstrated for me how you could set up and configure an iPhone without the need to see the screen or have assistance by another person. This demo had a huge impact to see what is possible with accessibility and its importance.\n\nHere are some resources that I keep handy when working on Jupyter's documentation. We are currently looking at updating our documentation themes (cc @gnestor @SylvainCorlay ), and I am sensitive to providing the best user experience with the resources that we have.\n\n**Resources**\nhttps://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/\nhttp://a11yproject.com\n\n**Tools**\nOne tool that I find helpful for a quick look at accessibility of a page is: http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/\n\nThe other resources provide a great list of available tools.\n\ncc @ivanov @fperez @minrk \n",

    "body": "Any updates on this issue?\r\n\r\nI'm a screen reader user and was taking a quick look at notebook's accessibility in preparation for a machine learning course at university that starts next month.\r\n\r\nUsing jupytar 1.0 and notebook 5.0, this is what I've found so far following a basic tutorial:\r\n\r\n* When creating a new jupytar notebook, there is no semantic indication in the markup that the name (untitled) is clickable\r\n* The toolbar (inside the `id=\"maintoolbar-container\"` element) have labels that are only visible when hovered over by the mouse since it uses the `title` attribute. This can be fixed by adding an `aria-label=\"...\"` attribute containing the same information.\r\n* In the blank code cell that is created by default, I can't reliably find the `<textarea>` to enter code. Am not sure if this is caused by the way the DOM's constructed there, or CSS. Even if I manage to land inside the `<textarea>`, I don't hear anything when arrowing about, which is definitely not normal. This is the most critical bug.\r\n* As a convenience feature, it would be really nice if the output of a code cell gets automatically read when I press shift+enter to run it. This can be done by adding the [`role=\"log\"`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#log) attribute to the `<div class=\"output_subarea output_text ...`.",
