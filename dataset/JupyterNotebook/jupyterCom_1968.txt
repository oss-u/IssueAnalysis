One case where this might not be sufficient is a hosted service where the notebook server is the only window on the system (e.g. JupyterHub, cloud services). In these cases, without a *read* API for the trash, you get something in the middle: lost access to files, but the data isn't actually cleaned up. But then again, trash is really something along the lines of a `~/.trash` folder, so it's *possible* to dig around and find what you lost.",
