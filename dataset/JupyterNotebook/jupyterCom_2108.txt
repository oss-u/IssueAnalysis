Including .py files would further complicate this already complicated band-aid. My answer would be that nbextension config shouldn't ever occur in `.py` config files because of this special handling.\r\n\r\n.py config files also already have a clearer, explicit merge mechanism, so shouldn't have to get mixed up in this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nc.Class.trait.update({'x': 5}) # update existing config, if any\r\n# vs\r\nc.Class.trait = {'x': 5} # override\r\n```",
