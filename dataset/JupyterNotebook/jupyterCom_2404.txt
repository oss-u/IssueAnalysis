    "body": "The sandboxing is so that HTML files you view cannot talk to kernels the server is running - it should mean that cross-domain protection kicks in between the content in the iframe and the notebook server.\r\n\r\nWe do sandbox it [with the allow-scripts flag](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/d00b7e3e17274bd879be4c23012ce5f6fbce896a/notebook/templates/view.html#L26), but maybe browsers aren't respecting that?\r\n\r\nWe should only need the sandboxing for files that can run code in the browser, like html and svg (?), so you can workaround this for a PDF by changing `/view/` to `/files/` in the URL. But PDF.js is probably complex enough that I'd have some reservations about letting it out of the sandbox by default, in case a malicious PDF can cause it to run Javascript and then talk to kernels.",
