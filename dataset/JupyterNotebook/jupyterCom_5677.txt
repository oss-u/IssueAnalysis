    "body": "Its not a bad idea. But if keeping cell output out of source control is your primary concern, the easiest solution is to just clear the outputs before committing. There are a few ways to do that:\r\n\r\n1. Use a [commit hook as outlined in Jupyter docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/savehooks.html).\r\n\r\n2. Use Jupyter's shortcut to \"clear all cell output\"\r\n\r\n3. Use [nbconvert to clear the notebook outputs](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/preprocessors.html#nbconvert.preprocessors.ClearOutputPreprocessor) before committing.\r\n\r\n4. You could also just write your own shell script to clear outputs. [I wrote one using `jq` to do that and it is fairly easy](https://github.com/gitjeff05/kapitsa/blob/master/lib/remove_cell_outputs.sh#L66).\r\n\r\nSome folks also choose to just convert the notebook to python using nbconvert and then just commit that. If you search for \"How to version control jupyter notebooks\" you will see a bunch of posts on the topic.",
