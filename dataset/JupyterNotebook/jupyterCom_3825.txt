    "body": "This is strange as we do run test on 2.7 and they pass. It's just the UI test that can't be run on 2.7.\r\n\r\n> I suggest that you should maintain compatibility with python-2.7 because Jupiter needs to be able to run all sorts of python packages\r\n\r\nNo, the kernel runs code, not the server. The server could be in Go/Rust/C or Ruby as far as you are concern. Also IPykernel (which does run the code) has already been python 3 only for a year or so,  if you need to run Python 2.7 code you will not get the latest version of the kernel already.\r\n\r\nWe could change the code to run the selenium test from Python 3 while the server runs python2, but that seem like a hassle.\r\n\r\nClosing as we are not likely to fix that; and will anyway stop Python 2 support in the server as well pretty soon. \r\n\r\nFeel free to keep commenting or ask for reopening if you'd like. \r\nIf you send a Pull-request fixing it may still be accepted.",
