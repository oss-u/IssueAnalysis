Or all kernels ?\n\nWhile I see why it would make some sens in a some case, I'm not sure the cost/benefit is worth such complexity yet.\n\nThere is also users asking for many kernel at once on the page, with variable kernel on a per cell basis. \n\nI think the [metakernel or calico kernel](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages) use to have the ability to actually proxy to other subkernels, so from the UI perspective there was 1 kernel, and with `%%%lang` you could change the current lang of the kernel. \nIt had advantages and drawback. \n",
