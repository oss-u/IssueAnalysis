Does it appear like custom.js is being loaded before the notebook (try adding a log statement in custom.js and verify that the log statement is the first one in the console when loading the notebook)? If not, then you either need to:\n- Upgrade notebook to 4.2.3\n- If you're running notebook from source, there is an [outstanding issue affecting master](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1770)\n\nIf it's not loading first, then setting the cell default config (as you are in your code example) after the config has been loaded will have no effect. \n\nIf it is loading first, then let me know and I will do some investigating.\n\nFYI, line number toggle status is persisted to nbconfig, so if you show line numbers in one notebook, they should show in any other notebooks you open on your computer. \n",
