I think it would work - or could be made to work.  \r\n\r\nThe issue is that it doesn't provide the ability for the user to opt-in to using async - which we need.  Another issue is that any custom managers that derive from the sync `MappingKernelManager` would break when suddenly (and unknowingly) derived from the async form of `MappingKernelManager`. Both of these issues would occur the moment the updated `jupyter_client` is installed.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does seem that `kernel_model()`, `list_kernels()` and `_check_kernel_id()` could move to the mixin (`MappingKernelManagerBase`).\r\n\r\nBtw, I noticed (after confirming with my dev partner - google) the mixin class is listed in the wrong position in the class definitions and will move it to precede the superclass names.",

I will always try to err on the side of maintainability.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm not quite following what confusion there is.  No one is using `AsyncMappingKernelManager` today.  To use `AsyncMappingKernelManager` they must \"opt-in\" by setting `c.NotebookApp.kernel_manager_class = AsyncMappingKernelManager`.  Doesn't it make sense that they would then need to adjust the relative traits to that class?  If they switch back, they might want different values for each class type and both can be defined, but only the \"in-use\" class's traits will take effect - is that right?",

The main confusion is that both mapping kernel managers are listed in `NotebookApp` classes list, and therefore both classes are listed in `--help-all` list at the same time. That's a pretty small price, I agree, but it does create some cognitive load on users exploring the traits in our help docs.\r\n\r\nRight now, if you write a custom kernel_manager_class, you would inherit and override `MappingKernelManager` methods, so the traits would be handled properly and the help documentation would still be consistent.\r\n\r\nI think we should follow this pattern here. AsyncMappingKernelManager should essentially be a subclass of MappingKernelManager.\r\n\r\nBecause you have the issue of a different class you're inheriting from jupyter_client in `AsyncMappingKernelManager`, namely `AsyncMultiKernelManager`, we could build this `AsyncMappingKernelManager` using a metaclass approach, where we swap out the `MultiKernelManager` for `AsyncMultiKernelManager` in the MRO of `MappingKernelManager`.\r\n\r\nLet me try it out. If it becomes too confusing or unmaintainable, I'll drop it. 😎 ",

    "body": "Hi @Zsailer - this should be ready for review/merge.  \r\n\r\nAside from adding the checks for 3.5, I found the test-skipping logic wasn't working correctly because the server startup occurs as part of the setup_class() method, while I had been \"skipping\" the test in the setUp() method - which was too late.  The python 3.5 group now shows this: `SKIP: AsyncKernelAPITest tests skipped due to Python < 3.6!`\r\n\r\nI also needed to add an initializer to the fake AsyncMultiKernelManager class that's fabricated. This allows the initial load (of the fabricated class) to succeed in order for the server to determine that an async kernel manager is being configured when it's not available/supported.  \r\n\r\nLastly, the test failure appears to be transient related to `nvm` installation.  I got the same installation failure on a different group in my repo.  [I reran the build](https://travis-ci.org/github/kevin-bates/notebook/builds/669930951) and the `nvm` installation succeeded.",
