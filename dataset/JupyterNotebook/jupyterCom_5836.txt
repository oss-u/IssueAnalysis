[anaconda-project](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-project) hardcodes the `default_url` [here](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-project/blob/3804895ffcea4f2a88747b245fb493a1c0d777bc/anaconda_project/project_commands.py#L167-L178). I would open your issue on that repo and see if they can help. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue here, but feel free to reopen if you keep having issues.",
