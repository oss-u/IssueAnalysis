Otherwise this is always going to be an issue because no matter however clever we are about updating links within a notebook, outside links can't be updated and will fail if there's any change in the header positioning (i.e., even if you were to do this in pandoc you would run into this problem). But if we encourage manual header specification, then permanent links can be guaranteed (since they aren't autogenerated).",
