    "body": "Hi @richdevboston - I don't think what you're experiencing was intentional, especially since lab 2.x (which also runs on the same notebook server) has this working.  In addition, given this used to work, this would be considered a regression and should be something that is addressed.\r\n\r\nI am unable to reproduce it on macOS 11.2.3 running Chrome 89.0.4389.82 and Python 3.7.8 (and also works when the server is on RHEL 7.9, Python 3.8). Here's a gif demonstrating what appears to be the intended behavior.  The Notebook version is 6.2.0, but I suspect there are other things in play relative to your environment.\r\n\r\n![NB6015](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22599560/111796922-e7727d00-8885-11eb-85aa-3661bc77979d.gif)\r\n\r\nI probably can't help much more than trying things out since this is likely something on the front-end or in the kernel itself and is not an issue in the server proper.  If there's anything you'd like me to try, just ask.\r\n\r\nIf anyone with more browser experience than myself (i.e., nearly zero) feels they can help, please chime in.  It would be great if someone on Windows 10 could check this out as well.",

This is also the former (expected) behavior for Jupyter CLASSIC Notebook on Windows 10.   \r\n\r\nFrom your GIF image file, it looks like you are launching the Jupyter Classic Notebook from the Jupyter Lab.  \r\n\r\nYou are right that it is probably a iPython kernel or JavaScript issue.  I don't know enough right now about the Jupyter Classic Notebook front-end code to fix it myself.  ",
