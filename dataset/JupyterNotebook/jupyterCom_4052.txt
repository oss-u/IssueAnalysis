It's a bid random so not easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThis happened when in cell `i`, there are multiple statements, **a statement in the middle** (not the last line in the cell) fails and does not assign variable `x`.\r\n\r\nA later cell `i+n` fails due to reference to variable `x`, I've seen fails at `n > 1`  but that's just because my notebook used `x` at later cells, no at `i+1`. \r\n\r\nThis started happening after I upgraded to `ipython 7.0.1`. Other details remain the same as above. \r\n\r\nWill try to see if I can build a notebook that produces this, In the meantime please let me know if you need anything else.",

    "body": "@esvhd thanks! I think that's a slightly different issue, but the abort-on-error logic also had to be rewritten with the async updates, so it makes sense that there might have been a change there, too. A notebook to reproduce would be super helpful, even if it's only intermittent. It's hard to reproduce an error based on a description alone. For instance [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/minrk/639102c3590a083c3a2bb11142b1927f) does what I think you are describing, but never seems to trigger the behavior you describe.\r\n\r\nA few points:\r\n\r\n- statement in the middle shouldn't be relevant. The only thing it cares or even knows about is whether an error is raised or not. But when a cell raises an error, all of the lines up to the error are still executed.\r\n- references to the variables should also not be relevant. The content is never considered when it comes to decisions like whether to execute a cell\r\n\r\nThe most relevant aspect of the stop-on-error behavior is that it's timing-based. When execution fails, the kernel aborts all messages that are waiting to be executed, and then waiting [50 milliseconds](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/fe52dbd726cb405eb3a1e74e6a7fdb32372150ed/ipykernel/kernelbase.py#L780) for more to arrive. If an execution that's part of a \"run all\" arrives significantly delayed (that is, at least 50 milliseconds later than the previous request).\r\n\r\nI've updated ipython/ipykernel#362 to increase this timeout to 100 milliseconds by default and make it configurable, which may mitigate the issue for you.",
