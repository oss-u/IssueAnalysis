Partially fixed #479 with this PR. \n\n## Current Doc Status\n\nThe `latest` docs reflects the current docs (though examples/tutorials not ideal though accessible) with the doc updates on security, changelogs, etc.  https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\nThe `stable` docs reflect the old build which handles the examples/tutorials section better https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Examples%20and%20Tutorials%20Index.html\n\n## Actions on RTD\n\nThis PR along with clearing the Advanced Settings in RTD (the checkbox and the requirements which was before doc/requirements.txt). Clearing the setup.py install checkbox allowed the build to complete without running `setup.py install --force` which was what was failing.\n\n<img width=\"867\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-09-24 at 2 35 49 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2680980/10087681/3e8e6cd0-62ca-11e5-8f80-8fc4f67903e1.png\">\n\n## Next step\n\nTry to update the latest build to fix the autogen of the notebooks on RTD without having to reenable the Advanced Setting checkbox.\n",
