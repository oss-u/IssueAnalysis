    "body": "Yes, MathML is basically HTML (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML). All these special MathML tags have to always be embedded in surrounding `<math>` tags, so the MathML stuff is clearly delineated from the rest of the document (and the LaTeX content, for that matter, which must not be embedded in `<math>` tags and must not contain `<math>` tags itself).\n\nOf course, the MathJax guys would know best, and I'm not a MathJax/MathML expert by any means, but from what I see and understand, the formats are clearly separated, since one is custom HTML with special tags and the other happens in the text content of regular HTML nodes.\n\nUsing the `TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML` configuration for MathJax, all `<math>` tags in a document are simply grabbed and rendered and the LaTeX rendering in the rest of the document is handled separately from this.\n\nIt's worth noting that some browsers, most notably Firefox, have builtin MathML support, and will render `<math>` tags and MathML even if MathJax is not installed. So in fact Jupyter running under Firefox already basically behaves like MathJax with the added MathML support would. You can output `<math>` tags in the HTML there and it renders math.\n\nThe only potential problem with `TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML` in my opinion might be AMS (AsciiMath), which could be configured to some obscure delimiters so as to be effectively disabled (see http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/asciimath.html). Sadly there's no standard MathJax configuration that only supports TeX and MML, you always get AMS in the bundle (see http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html).\n\nSo is this, i.e. switching to `TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML`, something that would be worth doing a new PR on master?\n",
