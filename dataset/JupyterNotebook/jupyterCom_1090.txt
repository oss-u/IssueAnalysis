    "body": "I'd like to add a vote for this issue, with one clarification: it should only scroll if the output is already scrolled down to the bottom.\r\n\r\nI often run calculations the produce output over some extended time, maybe printing another line every ten seconds or so.  I want to sit and watch the output as it appears.  But once it collapses all the output into a scrollable text area, it stops being visible.  I can scroll the output down to the bottom, but when the next line appears, it's always hidden off the bottom.  So I have to sit there with the mouse hovering over it, ready to scroll it down by hand every ten seconds just so I can see the next line that's just appeared.  This gets really irritating!\r\n\r\nOf course, I might also want to scroll back through the output and look over it while the code is still running.  If it kept jumping back to the bottom, that would also be irritating.  So this is the behavior I suggest.  If the cell's output is already scrolled to the bottom and new output appears, it should automatically scroll to make that new output visible.  If it's scrolled to anywhere other than the bottom, it should remain where it is when new output appears.\r\n\r\nAnd to be clear, I'm talking about scrolling the output of a particular cell.  I'm not talking about scrolling the whole window.",
