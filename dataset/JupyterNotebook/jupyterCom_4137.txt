I restart everything with \"Kernel / Restart &amp; clear output\". I ask \"Cell / Run all\". Expected outcome: Graph is plotted. Outcome seen: Graph is not plotted.\r\n\r\nI can then manually re-execute the cell. This causes the graph to be plotted.\r\n\r\nI can also try to render from the command line with `jupyter nbconvert bug.ipynb` . Expected outcome: The HTML generated shows the graph. Outcome seen: It doesn't.\r\n\r\nHere is my sample notebook that shows this behavior (wrapped in a ZIP archive, as github allows ZIP archives to be attached to issues):\r\n\r\n[bug.ipynb.zip](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/files/2757095/bug.ipynb.zip)\r\n\r\nMoving the line `import pandas as pd` from the third cell to the first fixes the problem for me, too.",
