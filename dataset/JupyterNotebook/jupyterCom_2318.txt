Maybe only an only inspector window and I got confused or something like that.\r\n\r\nGreat, I learned something more about JS today and I have a way to decorate any notebook function. In the other issue @takluyver already showed me how to use events though and I think that might be a cleaner way to do it, in cases where running the original function has the same meaning as firing the event. However, when a specific function does not fire such event, this can still be very useful, I think.",
