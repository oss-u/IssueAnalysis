    "body": "The auto-restart logic gets triggered when the notebook server can no longer determine the kernel _process_ is alive.  It could be that the process terminated for whatever reason, or the process is so busy doing work that the poll method gets starved and the server _thinks_ its no longer alive.  So I would check the process (commands like `ps -ef|grep jupyter` can help isolate the kernel process) and try to determine if it's stable (is the PID consistent).\r\n\r\nGiven that the kernel runs for a few minutes, I would also try to determine if anything could be associated to the cell being executed at the time.  Is it always the same cell in which the restart occurs?\r\n\r\nThen, compare environments.  Does the remote machine have the same libraries/packages (compare `pip freeze` outputs) where a deferred reference of a missing package might crash the kernel process?  Does the remote machine have at least the same kinds of resources, etc.?",

On the other way, if I continue to push the use of memory to a limit in my local, I'll have the dead kernel as well.\r\n\r\nWith such, this issue can be closed now. Thanks for the help!",
