Do people actually reuse our files and are suddently\ncompletly broke. How much work is it to update downstream from 4.x to 4.1.\n\nHow would for example IBM update that ? They probably go through a security\ncheck on their team, which lets say takes 4weeks. If the 4.0 to 4.1 patch\nis a few hundreds line then the security team can probably  check that 4.1\nis ok in a day or two.\n\nWith this they basically have to audit browserify too, because these tool\ncan generate vulnerability in code\njust by minification/optimisation.\n\nWhen you do a 4.0 to a 4.1 you have contract that are other than pure API,\nyou wouldn't change the language from python to perl, you would'nt change\nthe required compiler from GCC to LLVM,\nyou wouldn't drop support for IE8.\n\nRewriting all the module from AMD to common js is such a breakage IMHO. It\nmight work,\nit might not, but it will piss people off, and people that might not\ncomplain because they are\nusing that under NDA and will just think F&^% $#f and stop using the\nproject.\n\nAs a developper I am happy, and I would have merged and iterate on that\nearlier.\nMy community hat is just unhappy on the condition this was merged in.\n\nIt might just be yet another symptom of the lack of cmmunication,\nand sorry if it fell on one of your PRs, but someone have to speak up.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 27, 2015 at 7:13 PM, Jonathan Frederic <notifications@github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> The intention was for it to be backwards compatible - if it wasn't I would\n> have removed require.js.
