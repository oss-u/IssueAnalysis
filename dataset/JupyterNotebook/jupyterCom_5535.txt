Please see this https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5536#issuecomment-644778703.\r\n\r\nRegarding the re-installation of the kernel, do you see files in `/home/apeiyin/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3`?  Namely a `kernel.json` and a logo image file?  If so, I believe the error you're encountering is the command's inability to overwrite the existing files.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, you _could_ point Jupyter to use a different directory for these kinds of files by setting environment variable `JUPYTER_DATA_DIR` to a location you have more control over.
