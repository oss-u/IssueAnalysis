    "body": "You can use nbconvert to run a notebook non-interactively (with the `--execute` flag). You can automate that to run regularly using cron (on Unix systems), or Windows 'scheduled tasks' (does Windows still have that? I haven't used recent versions much). There are browser extensions you can get that automate reloading a page every few minutes. It's not a very integrated solution, but all the pieces are there to do it quite easily.\n\nA bit more challenging would be to write a JS extension that executes a given cell/cells on a schedule.\n",

I ended up finding this --execute option a while after I created this issue.\nI am going towards your solution as well, I'm going to execute the R notebook I have by calling Jupyter inside a Python application to generate the HTML report I want, and also I'm going to use an Add-On for Firefox that auto-reloads a HTML page whenever it is changed.\n\nI appreciate your time and effort, have a nice day.\n",
