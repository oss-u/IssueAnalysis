At times, the workplace/session can be restored and this should have been achieved by something left in the cache.\r\n\r\nTo be more precise, as I did not find a way to only clear Jupyter/localhost-relevant cache pieces, the following two steps cleared the `Blocking Cross Origin API request` message and restored the functionality of the notebooks:\r\n1. Launch `firefox` from the machine(Linux Mint) that hosts the Jupyter server. Visit `localhost:8889` on using the \"native\" Firefox browser (why not Chrome? Well, on the Linux machine, `sudo apt install firefox` got me a working Firefox, but Chrome took quite a hassle to install.)\r\n2. Then, go back to the local machine and visit `localhost:8889`.
