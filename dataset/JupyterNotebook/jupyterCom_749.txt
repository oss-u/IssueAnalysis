It looks like you're loading a second instance of jquery on top of the one already used by the notebook before loading the dataTable plugin.  This is likely leading to confusion with respect to which jquery is which, and which one is getting the dataTable plugin registered on it.  This is probably the problem in #499 as well.\n\nSome clearer developer documentation on how to define and require JS dependencies through AMD / RequireJS might be helpful here, as this is a (relatively) new thing many people (myself included) won't be highly familiar with.\n",

If I understand correctly the notebook is using RequireJS (e.g. https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/templates/page.html#L21) to load all JS modules.  This loads all JS asynchronously, but performs dependency resolution to ensure that scripts are loaded in the correct order based on their dependencies.  So for jQuery plugins for example it's going to be important that they're loaded _after_ jQuery (though I would think you would get an error from the plugin if `jQuery` isn't found in the globals?)\n\nIn any case, because of this scripts embedded directly in the page with `<script>` tags will run synchronously, more or less as soon as the browser parses the HTML.\n",

I'm also trying to use the dataTable plugin for jQuery, but I keep having a `TypeError: $(...).DataTable is not a function` error. I have included the dataTable library now with requirejs:\n\n```\n%%javascript\nrequire.config({\n  paths: {\n      datatables: '//cdn.datatables.net/1.10.11/js/jquery.dataTables.min'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nbut that doesn't seem to help. Can anyone help me how to add jQuery plugins to the notebook properly?\n",

    "body": "Thanks. Adding `shims: datatables: [\"jquery\"]` to the `require.config` object doesn't help. [This SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20093957/configuring-jquery-datatable-with-require-js-and-using-with-backbone-js) says that dataTables is already an AMD module and that there is no need to add a shim for it. However, that doesn't help either as that brings me back to the previous situation.\nRemains only one thing I guess: that `baseUrl` in the require config. The notebook source code you were referring to earlier sets this baseUrl using template tags, so I'm not sure to what it is set, and whether I should set the same url when trying to add dataTables. Any thoughts?\n",
