    "body": "Hi there. I came across the same problem. I've checked an issue link below. It doesn't look like garbage collector issue because of its wierd behaviour. This behaviour is exactly as following:\r\n1) Run the cell => It becomes frozen. The cell looks like a running one but nothing really happens: no results, no outputs - nothing.\r\n2) Interrupt the kernel.\r\n3) Run the cell again => It works like a charm immediately.\r\n4) Run again => doesn't work. Interrupt kernel, run again => it works. and so on and so on\r\n\r\nI also noticed that such behaviour was typical only when I utilized a lot of memory (after loading big csv, dbf or txt files). So here is the same issue as topicstarter has, but described in other words :)\r\n\r\nThanks",
