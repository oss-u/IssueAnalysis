The part of the error:\n\n```\n[C 21:53:35.843 NotebookApp] The 'contents_manager_class' trait of <notebook.notebookapp.NotebookApp object at 0x7fca5ad369b0> instance must be a type, but 'ipymd.IPymdContentsManager' could not be imported\n```\n\nLike ly the config file will be in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` (you can check with `jupyter --config-dir`)\n\n> And, I get the same message as posted above! If anaconda is supposed to be isolated environment and it installed successfully and path was set to it then I would expect it to work.\n\nThe only difference is that the Jupyter/IPython config is global, so if you have a issue in your config this might happen. This is needed as users might want to run only on server with various conda env\n\nAnaconda will also only provide isolation if you are using bash, and don't mess with $PATH in a way that anaconda can't prevent. Typically it needs to shell-out to some external programs. And if $PATH is not correct, it can't know. \n\nAnyway, if it works by commenting the config, we can try to reinstall `ipymd` in the right environment to get you set up again. \n\nSorry for the trouble you are encountering. \n",
