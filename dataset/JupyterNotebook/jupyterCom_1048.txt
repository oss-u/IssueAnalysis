    "body": "I would be in favor of adding some sort of visual indicator for this, but I don't know if it should be easy for people to change the deleteable status by hand. The idea for using it with nbgrader is that it should be quite difficult/annoying to delete cells that are marked as undeleteable, because removing them will totally break nbgrader.\n\nI would guess there are kind of two competing use cases for this functionality. The first, like how nbgrader uses it, is a way for applications that produce notebooks to control how users use those notebooks. The second is a way for users to \"lock\" cells to prevent themselves from accidentally deleting them. In the first case, there shouldn't be an easy way to toggle it except programmatically; in the second case, there should be. So I guess it depends on what type of functionality the undeletable feature is meant to be \"for\".\n",

Either that or a feature that automatically compiles the cell if the cursor/focus leaves the cell again.\r\n\r\nThis is paired with another issue I had:\r\nWhen your text cursor is in a code cell and you press up/down on your arrow keys it leaves the code cell and enters the text cell above/below and goes into the editing/markup mode. Which is highly annoying when you want to traverse your source code with the arrow keys.",
