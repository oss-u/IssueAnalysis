    "body": "@gnestor: Thanks. All I'm seeing on my login page is a password field. No description, even with having the password option commented out in the jupyter options. As from the security doc, jupyter is supposed to ask for a token in this case, which it does not (at least not on my machine). However, the token from the terminal works as a password in this case. The only other option set in my jupyter config is `c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False`. So, I'm guessing this is the real issue. If set to `True` one would automatically be logged in with a token.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1119641/21259342/3215e0dc-c381-11e6-8706-0975dfa27925.png)\r\n\r\nThis is indeed very confusing.
