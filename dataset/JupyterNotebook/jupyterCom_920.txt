    "body": "Yup, I'm not 100% sure right now what the issue is, but the problem is a layer down, in the kernel itself. It manifests itself in the notebook for you, but it can be seen at the terminal if you connect to a 'raw' kernel from a console. I just moved the bug over to the [kernel package](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/91) where we'll ultimately have to fix the actual problem, will close this one here and we can continue tracking the problem over there...\n\nThanks for reporting it, and sorry about this!!\n",
