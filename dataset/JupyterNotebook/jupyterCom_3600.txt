    "body": "Thanks. I was not enough aware what components could be updated. \r\n\r\nThe IPython update certainly changed this. Now, unfortunately, before hitting Shift Enter in a cell describing the class, there is no Tab-autocomplete anymore of attributes on an instance.\r\nAfter Shift-Entering a cell though, there is, and indeed every attribute once; this last thing is very nice of course.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to have the autocomplete options also available before the cell was executed, it is a pity that has gone. If that is a necessary thing to have the attribute-doubling go away, then it must be so. If it is still possible though to get tab autocomplete to work also before executing the cell, (as it did before the update of ipython) that would be the best of course :)",
