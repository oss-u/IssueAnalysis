Unless it's defined when more messages cannot be sent, though, the callbacks can never be freed and the client is guaranteed to use up progressively more resources, since it never knows that it will not receive any more messages.\n\nIf that is the intended / expected behavior for clients for the time being, go ahead and close this :)\n",
