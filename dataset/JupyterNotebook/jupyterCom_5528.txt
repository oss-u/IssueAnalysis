    "body": "Hi @CT-Suimz.  The Notebook-related docker image files are built and maintained via the https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks repository.  These are periodically (or triggered via GH events) built from released packages.  \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"notebook file\".  Are you saying you've made a code change to the Notebook package and want to incorporate that change in a docker image?\r\n\r\nOr are you saying you've modified an actual notebook (ipynb file) and would like to build a docker image from within a running notebook?\r\n\r\nI suspect the former.  So, if you'd like to test out a change within a docker image, I would use the docker-stacks repository as a reference and just extend an existing notebook image of your choice to try your changes out. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps, otherwise, could you please clarify your question?  Thanks.",
