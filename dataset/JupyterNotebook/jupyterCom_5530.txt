The reason I bring that up is because if you were to make these changes in one of notebook or jupyter_server repos, it would probably be of higher value applied only to the latter (jupyter_server) - since that's more in the long-range plans of the ecosystem.  However, if you'd like to apply to both repositories, these changes are more than welcome!",
