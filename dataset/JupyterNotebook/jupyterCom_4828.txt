Just asking since the latter would leave the kernel running along with any supporting processes.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, try not using `-9` (SIGKILL) and see if you still see the zombie ZMQbg processes.\r\n\r\n(You'll probably need to reboot to clear up the current zombies since they're owned by init.  Please try the `kill -15` experiment first so you'd only need to reboot once should it prove unhelpful.)",
