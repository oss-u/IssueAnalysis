    "body": "Hi, \n\nThanks, for writing all these things up. Probably out of order responses:\n\n1) You might want to contact jupyter-education google group. People there might be also interested. \n\n2) The current server is extensible, you can add tornado handler, but not super easy, we are planning on having things more pluggable, we are actively working on it, but it will not be there soon. \n\n3) Yes you can embed, WSGI will likely not be enough for the notebook, that's why we have jupyterhub that can serve the notebook under one prefix, and other app under the other. It's based on a live http proxy that can update routing URLs without restart and without drooping websocket connexion. As far as we know there is not that  many apps capable of doing that.  [see there](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/deploying-jupyterhub-for-education/) for detail. It can handle a few hundreds of people. \n\n4) another alternative, we are working on is making notebook component reusable, so you might be able to just embed the part of Jupyter you like.\n\nYou are likely to reach more people by writing to jupyter/jupyter-education google groups. I can't promise resources, that will likely be on a per-person basis if they decide to dedicate time on that. \n\nVarious related project that might be useful to you:\n- mybinder.org\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/jupyter-education\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/jupyter\n- https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe\n- https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader\n- https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub\n",
