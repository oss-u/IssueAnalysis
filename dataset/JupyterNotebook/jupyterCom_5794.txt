Looking at the recent change: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/5120/files\r\nwould it work to restore the `'ctrl-enter'` entry while _leaving_ the `'cmdtrl-enter'` line in place.  This would mean that _either_ cmd-enter or ctrl-enter invoke a cell on mac while other platforms expect only ctrl-enter.\r\n\r\nWould someone be willing to give this a try?  Thanks.",

    "body": "hi @kevin-bates ,\r\n\r\nThanks for merging the fix ! I've tried it on my side but cannot get it to work :( .\r\n\r\nI am now in a new environment, using notebook 6.1.5. Although, as I understand, this fix is not part of this version.\r\nHowever, I edited `keyboardmanager.js` in my notebook installation (`/miniconda3//lib/python3.8/site-packages/notebook/static/notebook/js/keyboardmanager.js` ), but it doesn't seem to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAdding `'ctrl-enter'  : 'jupyter-notebook:run-cell',` to the mapping does nothing. I;ve also tried lifting the existing `cmdtrl-enter` mapping, but it still works. I think this file is somehow cached but cannot figure out where. Any ideas ? (I have restarted the server, to no avail).\r\n\r\nThank you ! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: ah, the file is not used directly, but actually used in building `main.min.js`. I've updated the mapping in `main.min.js` and it works. Thank you ! Waiting for the next release to be actually widely available ",
