    "body": "@takluyver I wonder if instead, we can pass timing info back to the client as part of the Jupyter protocol. That's the only real way to get timing info - since I can't seem to find a way for IPython extensions to modify the structure of the output sent back to the client. Solutions like https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/execute_time only measure time on the client side, so are subject to network delay & refresh artifacts. Knowing the timing information for cell executions can be quite important for certain pedagogical purposes.\r\n\r\nI'll be totally happy if I can do this as an extension tho :)",
