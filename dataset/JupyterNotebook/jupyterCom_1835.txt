I'm running on RHEL7.2, and I'm using the system provided httpd(-2.4.6-40.el7.centos.4.x86_64)\n\n```\n$ yum info httpd\nLoaded plugins: product-id, rhnplugin, search-disabled-repos, subscription-\n              : manager\nThis system is receiving updates from RHN Classic or Red Hat Satellite.\nInstalled Packages\nName        : httpd\nArch        : x86_64\nVersion     : 2.4.6\nRelease     : 40.el7_2.4\nSize        : 3.7 M\nRepo        : installed\nFrom repo   : rhel-x86_64-server-7\nSummary     : Apache HTTP Server\nURL         : http://httpd.apache.org/\nLicense     : ASL 2.0\nDescription : The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible\n            : web server.\n```\n\nI'm currently testing against  https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/f8229c9fb6ab5a5135f67ea253e6833cebd761f7 along with [notebook (4.2.2)](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/4.2.2) I see slightly different behaviour if I test against https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/2985562c2f482ba783bc5f7c167a5d8030d9fdf8 and [notebook (4.2.3)](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/4.2.3) but the global result is the same, Firefox and Safari seem to allow the restart, Chrome doesn't.\n\nI'll try to bring one system up the the latest versions of the hub and notebook and see if that makes a difference.\n\n**Edit**: I'm now on https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/a3eb2d2b9a5c34ff7e538a281d037951d8482bb7 and [notebook (4.2.3)](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/4.2.3) and RedHat's most recent httpd but I still can't reconnect to a kernel in Chrome. If I jump back to Home in another tab I can see the notebook in the Running tab and if I click on it I can connect to it no problem. The problem seems to be restricted to reconnecting from inside the notebook.\n",
