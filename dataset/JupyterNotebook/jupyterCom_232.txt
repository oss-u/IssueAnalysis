But if the CSS & JS aren't already built, it is a problem, and hiding the error makes it less clear what has actually gone wrong.\n\nOf course, the trouble is that it's the same code for installing from source as for installing from an sdist, where it ideally shouldn't even try to build the CSS & JS. But I wonder if we could do something smarter so the real error is clearer in cases like this.\n",
