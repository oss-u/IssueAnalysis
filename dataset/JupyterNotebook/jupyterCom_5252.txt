Perhaps the env instantiated on behalf of the kernel is missing some fundamental directory (e.g., /bin) that causes basic commands like 'ls' to appear as though they're not available, yielding `ENOENT`.",

    "body": "Thank you for your response. Agreed: I don't know where I got \"1.0\" from... Here is the output from `jupyter --version`:\r\n```\r\njupyter core     : 4.5.0\r\njupyter-notebook : 6.0.1\r\nqtconsole        : 4.5.5\r\nipython          : 7.8.0\r\nipykernel        : 5.1.2\r\njupyter client   : 5.3.3\r\njupyter lab      : 1.1.4\r\nnbconvert        : 5.6.0\r\nipywidgets       : 7.5.1\r\nnbformat         : 4.4.0\r\ntraitlets        : 4.3.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, bang format works every time! All the commands worked from Jupyter. I also used it to check the PATH variable, as you suggested. Everything looked normal there (as far as I can see, anyway): \r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/juno/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-2019.10/bin:/home/juno/.pyenv/libexec:/home/juno/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/bin:/home/juno/.local/bin:/home/juno/.pyenv/shims:~/.local/bin:/home/juno/.pyenv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am assuming the return code of `1` in your `pdflatex` cell is because you did not actually have a `\"MyFileName.tex\"` but that is the return code that I am also getting from my script, which is what I was originally trying to fix. It seems that a latex compile error occurs (so says my log) when run from within Jupyter but when run from the command line or from IPython, the latex compiler has no problem at the compiling point that it previously had an issue with.\r\n\r\nI also don't have this issue on my Windows machine.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts based on this information. I am grateful for your help thus far. If nothing comes to mind, I will keep playing with this and post something when I hopefully get it solved.\r\n",

    "body": "Correct, the .tex file didn't exist.  I downloaded a sample.tex file and still received return code 1, but that was also produced from the shell.  Downloading a different sample, I was able to create a pdf file from both the shell and notebook (returncode 0).\r\n\r\nYour PATH seems fine - no glaring ommissions of basic directories.  I'm assuming things like `ls` are in `/bin` or `/usr/bin` in your installation.\r\n\r\nVery strange.  I'm not thinking of anything at the moment.  I think the area of focus would be ipykernel and ipython.  Since ipython appears to work directly, that would likely leave the former.  Can you confirm you're using the same ipykernel version on Ubuntu and Windows?\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this in my \"retention buffer\" in case anything comes to mind.  Thanks for coming back to update the issue should you find anything.",
