It does not occur using Lab, so there's some missing escape logic in the save-as functionality.\r\n\r\nWe're minimally \"staffed\" on frontend maintainers at the moment, so until a fix can be contributed, using Lab or the manual replacement workaround will need to suffice.  Sorry for the inconvenience.",
