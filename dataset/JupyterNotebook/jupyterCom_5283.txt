    "body": "These messages are consistent with the front-end losing track of its back-end such that it sends requests relative to a kernel that it knows about, but the back-end doesn't.  Also, the port conflict on 8888 at startup indicates there's another notebook server running (or some other app) that perhaps knows about kernel id `fbacafca-c9ce-4fd7-8a09-a088af0abe1c`.\r\n\r\nI would suggest restarting the notebook server after properly stopping the existing instance(s).\r\n\r\nPrior to that, one exercise that might be interesting is to change the port in your browser back to `8888` to see if it reestablishes a connection to that particular kernel.  This depends on your affinity to that particular kernel instance.",
