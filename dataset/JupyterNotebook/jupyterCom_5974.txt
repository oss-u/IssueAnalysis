    "body": "Hi @blairdrummond - thank you for the pull request.  \r\n\r\nWhile this approach will certainly work, I was envisioning the initialization of `authenticate_prometheus`'s default value (which is currently hard-coded to `True`) as the means of addressing this.  This way, references to the other two trait values can remain in the application module.  \r\n\r\nA great example of this happens to be for the [`token` trait's default-value function in which it checks the `password`'s value](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/notebookapp.py#L999).  I think adding a `_default_authenticate_prometheus()` function that checks the `token` and `password` values would be the appropriate approach with the ultimate default value being `True`. \r\n\r\nAnother example is the [`mathjax_url` default checking the `enable_mathjax` trait](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/notebookapp.py#L1350-L1353).\r\n\r\nI hope that helps.  Thank again.",
