We also provide [a tool ](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/tools/secure_notebook.py) to automaticlly secure notebooks. \n\nAs far as I can tell, once a notebook server is secured over https + password the server should be immune to the attach describe.  \n\nIf they are over http, then notebook are anyway susceptible to another wide range of attack. Maybe not remote with DNS poisoning, but they give all users and program of the current machine shell access as the user who run the notebook servers/kernels. \n\nUnfortunately it is relatively hard to automatically generate a trusted-self-signed certificate for a machine it is (still) something we cannot enforce without manual user intervention. \n\nI'm going to refer to @rgbkrk, @minrk and @yuvipanda  to be sure, and likely push a bit more user to set-up ssl. \n\n> Didn't know ipython.org was still around\n\nOh, we are the same developers and IPython is still actively developed.

You need to know the kernel ID for this, however.\r\n\r\nHere's how to replicate it:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form enctype=\"text/plain\" method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost:8888/api/kernels\">\r\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a running notebook server, serve this (`python3 -m http.server`), open in a browser and click submit. On my system, Chromium sends an `Origin` header, so the origin check blocks it, but Firefox does not, so a kernel starts.\r\n\r\nA simple mitigation for the first two cases would be for `get_json_body` to expect a JSON object, even if it's empty.
