If a PR affects master and should be backported, the general flow is:\n1. mark PR with milestone for the next backport release (4.3)\n2. merge into master\n3. backport to 4.x\n4. push updated 4.x branch\n\nBackports can be done in a variety of ways, but we have [a script](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/tools/backport_pr.py) for automating the common process of:\n1. download [the patch](https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/jupyter/notebook/pull/1645.patch)\n2. checkout the 4.x branch\n3. apply the patch\n4. make a commit\n\nwhich works for simple cases, at leats.\n\nIn this case, it would be:\n\n```\npython /path/to/ipython-repo/tools/backport_pr.py jupyter/notebook 4.x 1645\n```\n\nAfter master and backport branches have diverged, the script may not work and backporting the patch by hand may be necessary. If you want to be conservative after manually backporting a patch, a PR against the backport branch would be appropriate.\n",
