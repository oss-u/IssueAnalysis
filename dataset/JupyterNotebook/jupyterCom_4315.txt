It does include overwriting the line and (I think) backspace, but not the arbitrary cursor movement commands.\r\n\r\nI suspect it's not worth trying to support arbitrary cursor movement - we're not presenting a terminal UI, so there's only so much of the terminal that can be emulated. But if someone wanted to work out a specific proposal (e.g. handling movement to cells on the same line), it's not necessarily impossible.",
