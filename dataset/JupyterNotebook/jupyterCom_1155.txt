    "body": "Ok, I understand this may not fit in development plans for Jupyter. I would still think it could be useful, maybe as part of a separate kernel or iPython extension.\n\nActually, my typical use case for Jupyter + iPython kernel is to run scientific computation. I am then looking forward having some features made easily accessible:\n- Distributed computation, to dispatch evaluation of notebooks or cells on different kernels / machines, without having to think about it.\n- A backup of the state of the notebook, to be able to recover from a kernel failure (when running out of memory for instance) and avoid having to backup data on my own.\n- As part of it, some abstraction from the low-level interfaces and stuff like threads, to write code more easily and quickly.\n\nI am not sure if this is the typical use case for Jupyter, but some of the features are already implemented, with various stability, either in Jupyter or in extensions. I am wondering how much people would be interested in such features, especially as the one described in this issue.\n\nConcerning this issue particularly, I might have a look at kernels or writing iPython extension, if it can be of interest. I am particularly aware that threads and sharing memory is an open door for many additionnal issues, but some basic implementation may be doable, in my opinion. Especially if we either restrict this feature to very specific cases, in which we are sure there are no side effects, or let the user explicitly turn on the feature (in which case, he is responsible for it). Moreover, maybe it would be easier to do with some kernels rather than others (thinking in Julia for instance).\n",

My idea, and the reason I posted on Jupyter/notebook is that I think it would be really awesome to have something well integrated and packaged. One of the major feature of Jupyter notebook and iPython kernel is that it \"just works\", and gives a really user-friendly setup for advanced tasks, out of the box :)\n\nI think I will try to see what I can get from assembling all of this, and if it could be worth integrating further in Jupyter, _via_ extensions or custom kernels.\n",

    "body": "FYI, I've been able to do some basic multithreading in Jupyter notebooks by subclassing multiprocessing.Process with ipywidgets for feedback.  It works pretty well!  In the future, I might use button widgets for spawning and stopping processes.  I'm actually using this to run a flask server that serves a REST api for some data that's processed in parallel.  I wanted to be able to use my Jupyter notebook to serve analyses in a way that could be used outside of Python.  The flask process and the data analyzer are each running in their own Process subclasses and are sharing data via Manager objects.  Using this system, I can start and stop new analyzers for the flask process to serve, all from the same notebook.  It's pretty nice!",
