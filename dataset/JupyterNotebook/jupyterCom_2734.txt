Subsequent presses highlight successive items in the list, and place them at the cursor. Hit `<RETURN>` to close the popup and add the selection to your line. This is how autocomplete works in many editors.\r\n\r\nHere's what you see in notebook after pressing `a<TAB><TAB><TAB><TAB>`. The first `<TAB>` opens the popup, but subsequent presses do nothing. To select you have to use the arrow keys (which is slower than continuing to hit tab, and extra slow because they're far from the home row on a standard keyboard).\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-22 at 22 24 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/370930/31898311-b2e8ca3a-b7cd-11e7-94df-90277282759b.png)\r\n\r\nSo: would it be possible to make repeated presses of the `<TAB>` key in notebook cycle through autocomplete options as they do in ipython?",
