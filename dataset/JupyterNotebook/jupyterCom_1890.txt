    "body": "Interesting idea, but I'm not convinced that we need to add anything to our process.\n\nWe already use milestones to indicate issues which we'd like to fix before a given release - e.g. [here's the 4.3 milestone](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/milestone/9). When preparing for a release, we go through those issues to either fix them or bump them to a later milestone. I've just done a pass on this for 4.3. In theory, we could save some time if we had an easy way to distinguish issues we consider important to fix from things that are less important, but we'd put the fix in that release if one was ready. But I suspect it wouldn't save that much time, and I think going back and looking at these issues again is probably healthy for the project.\n\nIf we do add a label, I'd argue that it should be the other way round, i.e. tag issues that we don't mind bumping to a later release. If we tag release blockers, we would still need to go through the issues without the tag to see if any of them should get the tag. I.e. if we add an issue to a milestone, I'd treat it as a release blocker by default.\n",
