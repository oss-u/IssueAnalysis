    "body": "This problem actually brought up a design issue related to the field being edited that I have seen for a little while. Currently when you are editing a cell and its the one selected (like in the example gif attached), the side indicator changes from blue to this green:\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-08 at 2 46 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6437976/14398691/0566f636-fd9b-11e5-9000-03caaee2f54a.png)\n\nBut, why do we need to change this color on the side when it is actually the cell being edited? To make it apparent to the user that it is the current cell being edited and that it is the one selected, couldn't we just make the cell itself turn from the gray background to white along with adding a blue glow that matches the blue on the left side showing it is the cell selected. This accomplished both tasks of showing which cell is being selected along with that it is in focus/editing mode:\n\n![editing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6437976/14398731/400654da-fd9b-11e5-9441-847ef5f9662e.png)\n\nUsing this method of cell selection enables us to then solely change the color of the hue of the glow around the cell to show that we are dropping an image into the cell/doing a different action than editing the text within the cell:\n\n![dropzone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6437976/14398840/2ef55046-fd9c-11e5-83ef-9ff22ed988ff.png)\n\nI think doing so also fixes some collisions in colors that we will face if we add yet another color to our Notebook UI. Thoughts? Of course if we like this concept I will need to open another issue to elaborate on this idea but I felt this was a good time and situation to bring up this design collision.\n",
