All of the layers try to helpfully do the re-scaling and can step on each other's toes.\r\n\r\nThe second behavior is the correct and expected behavior.  The font size is always specified in absolute points (1/72 in).   Setting it to 'smaller' is just a scaling factor relative to the default font size.   If you count the size in pixels of the text in the underlying png the text should be the same size (assuming the same dpi).\r\n\r\nI think in the 'big' case Jupyter is scaling the png down (as it is not 5 times wider in your screen shots than the 'small' one) by telling the browser to make it smaller in pixels than it really is.  This is also what gives you the apparent scaling when you narrow the width of the browser.",

I really do like the scaling down effect when making the browser window narrower, but it would be really great, if you could set an initial width and/or height for the figures displayed in the notebook, i.e. of the div or whatever that contains the final drawn figure. maybe even independent of the matplotlib figure sizes, which someone might want to set differently for saving the figures.",
