Are you displaying the actual console output?  Is this occurring when attempting to delete a file (since you indicate that's an issue as well) or just after starting the notebook server?\r\n\r\nRegarding section b).  `c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False` is the syntax used in the notebook configuration file (`jupyter_notebook_config.py`) to set the configurable attribute `use_redirect_file`.  This option can also be set from the command line when launching the notebook server:\r\n```\r\njupyter notebook --NotebookApp.use_redirect_file=False\r\n```\r\nNote that there's no `c.` prefix when using the command line option.  I would also recommend using `--debug` to enable DEBUG logging until you've gotten past these issues.",

The problem, was that when I launched the notebook it didn't popup automatically but instead I had to copy and paste the link. I could get along with this, but when I deleted a file on the notebook it didn't let me and i had an error message. But funny thing, somehow it got fixed by himself (because since I asked for help I didn't get the time to touch it) and now it's working fine haha. Quite disconcerting. \r\n\r\nThank you very much @kevin-bates for the help, I really appreciate I will keep your instructions in the case it's going nuts again.\r\n\r\nHave a good day. \r\nAdrien",
