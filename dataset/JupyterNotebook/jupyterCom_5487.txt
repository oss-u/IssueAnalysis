    "body": "We had another occurrence of this in #6038 and it too exhibited the behavior that this was not an issue using Lab, yet included pandas in its problem definition.  \r\n\r\nDo any frontend devs have any ideas why this behavior might be exhibited with notebook but not lab?  Can the front end get into any kind of deadlocked state that invoking interrupt alleviates?  I suspect the interrupt is not actually interrupting the kernel's execution but rather something in the front end.  Perhaps there's some intelli-sense type logic where pandas exacerbate this situation? ",
