    "body": "I believe this issue is due to there being a mounted, or non-native, Windows filesystem in play here.  This is based on the traceback that shows some modules (namely, notebook) installed in `\\india.eclerx.com\\ctrxdata\\ARRDATA\\Shreyansh.Vaghela\\Application Data\\Python\\Python37\\site-packages\\notebook`.\r\n\r\nWhen a kernel is started, Jupyter writes the kernel's connection information to a file that is protected using native platform permissions.  Windows can be a bit finicky about this and I suspect these \"dual modes\" are interfering with the `secure_write()` method.  Assuming this is the case, there are a couple of actions you can take...\r\n1. Relocate the Jupyter runtime files - such as connection files - to a local, native, filesystem location.  This can be accomplished by setting the environment variable `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR` to a native folder with appropriate permissions for applications to create files within.  E.g., `set JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR=C:\\jupyter\\runtime` where `C:\\jupyter\\runtime` is created prior to the launch of the notebook server.\r\n2. If you're not concerned about the security of the kernel connection information, you can set `JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES=1`, which bypasses this particular `SetFileSecurity` call.  Note that there may be a general issue with writing to some mounted filesystems, so if this didn't work, you'd likely need to go with option 1.\r\n\r\nShould you not get moving forward, please provide the output of `jupyter troubleshoot`.  At that time, we will likely relocate this issue to [`jupyter_core`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core), where this applicable code resides.",
