Above, this was occurring in the jupyter/tensorflow-notebook Docker image from about a month ago, with a few things installed, and a few updates run.\r\n\r\nI've pulled the latest image with the below versions, and with nothing else installed/no updates run. Behavior is slightly different, but the issue still occurs intermittently, apparently varying based on a) if Jupyter Lab is freshly started, b) if kernel has been restarted, and c) whether the shell command has been run. \r\n\r\nSo, if you're trying to reproduce, treat as intermittent, and test with variations of those three factors.\r\n\r\nVersions from the latest image where this is happening: \r\n`'3.7.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jan  7 2020, 22:33:48) \\n[GCC 7.3.0]'`\r\n\r\n```jupyter core     : 4.6.3\r\njupyter-notebook : 6.0.3\r\nqtconsole        : not installed\r\nipython          : 7.13.0\r\nipykernel        : 5.1.4\r\njupyter client   : 6.0.0\r\njupyter lab      : 1.2.5\r\nnbconvert        : 5.6.1\r\nipywidgets       : 7.5.1\r\nnbformat         : 5.0.4\r\ntraitlets        : 4.3.3\r\n```",
