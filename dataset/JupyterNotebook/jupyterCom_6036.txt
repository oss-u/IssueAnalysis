    "body": "Hi @mona950101 - I'm not able to reproduce this issue.  I do find it takes a while to complete the first completion (following `df.`) and I think that's been a common complaint relative to `pandas` (probably due to the large API set it provides).  Here are the versions of the _interesting_ packages I'm running with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nipykernel==5.5.3\r\nipython==7.22.0\r\njedi==0.18.0\r\njupyter-client==6.1.12\r\nnotebook==6.3.0\r\nnumpy==1.18.5\r\npandas==1.2.3\r\n\r\npython==3.7.8\r\n```\r\nIn looking around via google, it seems like there's been recent success with the `%config` magic to disable Jedi as described in this SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40536560/ipython-and-jupyter-autocomplete-not-working\r\n\r\nWhen I use that magic, the slowness factor seems much improved (purely based on observation).\r\n\r\nPerhaps something here might help you.\r\n\r\nI recommend trying to stay on a more recent version of IPython and not downgrading if possible.\r\n\r\n",
