    "body": "> When we merged the multiple selection PR, it was my impression (perhaps false) that we would be iterating in master to align it with the design that we all agreed upon.\n\nWe said that we **could** iterate on design, but as far as I am concern we did not say that we **would**. \n\n> The main thing that still needs to be changed before 4.1 is that we agreed that the edit mode border would be grey (with the green left border). This is important to me:\n\nI would have **never** agreed to that. We have many place on the internet that say that cell in edit mode have the green border. Making it gray would make all these description false, and will make any statement that describe only the left border as Green wrong for 4.0. \n\nSo no, I'll be strongly no-go in removing the green border **especially** since we've been in beta/rc for 10+days, and changing that would definitively mean reverting to a pre-beta state. \n\nI actually find the new green **less** agressive than the previous one. Though if you **really** want to revert the shade of green, I won't refuse. \n\n> Between the green 5px left border and brighter green, it is just too much for a UI element that gets shown to the user that often.\n\nBrian, I think you are on of the expert in the notebook which is the most sensible to design, we we appreciate a lot, though in the other hand, I have seen many comment where only a 1px green border change of color is indistinguishable for many people. \nFor example software carpentry, on overhead projector. We have the luxury of working with high-res monitor, of extremely good quality and are able to see changes that other don't. \n\nPlease try to consider that this change will actually be visually helpful for many people.\n",

    "body": "OK, I am back from the holiday. @Carreau are you around tomorrow to chat about this?\n\nIn the meantime...\n\nFor the record, here is the original discussion:\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/708\n\nHere is a sketch of the discussion:\n- There was initial strong support for option D - but it had _no_ styling of edit mode.\n- I later added the MD Green #400+grey combination for edit mode to clarify how edit mode would be treated consistently with the new MC colors.\n- Then Fernando suggested the D+modified, which seemed to be the most popular.\n- All left borders were 5px.\n\nWhat is implemented in master is someone different in multiple respects:\n- It uses the original D, that has Material Design Blue #200 on the left border and Blue #50 fill on soft-selected cells.\n- It uses the MD Green #400 used in my modification, but without the grey border.\n- The left border widths are not 5px and they vary between the different states.\n\nWhen I merged the PR, I knew there were minor style differences, but didn't want those to stall the more difficult behavioral testing of everything. I definitely should have clarified that my merging was conditional on us finishing the agreed upon visual design in master. But let's move forward...\n\n1) While I like the pseudo-original D that is implemented in master (with the left MB Blue #200 border in multiple selected mode), I don't think was what we agreed upon. Do we need to change that?\n\n2) Everyone liked the 5px left border always, I don't see any reason to not implement that. \n\n3) What to do about the edit mode styling? I used the MD Green #400 to match the MD Blue #400 of the command mode styling. Both of those choices were made based on the relatively small amount of area covered by those colors - they need to be relatively strong, but wouldn't work well if the area was larger. I used the grey edit border because that green would be too much to use on the entire border, and the grey is consistent with the rest of our UI. I still like that best:\n\n<img width=\"966\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-28 at 9 02 39 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27600/12029899/513bd4e6-adaa-11e5-9196-988c0aca89d9.png\">\n\nAnother option would be to use a slightly more subtle MD Green like #200 for the rest of the border.\n\n<img width=\"964\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-28 at 8 56 36 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27600/12029903/5e4c3ec8-adaa-11e5-9cc0-2025b43e1ebd.png\">\n\n4) There is also a darker blue _right_ border that I think looks like a bug, but maybe it is deliberate? In either case, we never agreed upon that so it should be removed:\n\n<img width=\"101\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-28 at 9 13 30 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27600/12029909/7918e53a-adaa-11e5-89ef-eae3a1ec67ec.png\">\n",

And I don't understand the link either in context. \n\n> I used the grey edit border because that green would be too much to use on the entire border, and the grey is consistent with the rest of our UI. I still like that best:\n\nThere is no way I'l accept to change edit border to gray for 4.1. You can send PR and everything, I'll do all I can for edit border will stay green for 4.1. We went over the beta/RC cycle and more weeks with green as the border. I will be opposed to change that post rc (regardless of wether or not i like it).\n\nWe can refine and do that for a 4.2 if you really want it after a few weeks of testing it locally and discuss that longer, I have no problem. But 4.1 is post-freeze.\n\nI'll make an exception and allow adjusting the green exceptionally.\n\n> 4) There is also a darker blue right border that I think looks like a bug, but maybe it is deliberate? \n\nLikely not deliberate, \n\n> In either case, we never agreed upon that so it should be removed.\n\nI might misunderstand the \"should\" in context, but I would avoid such strong statement which seem like an unilateral decision to me. I for example like it now that I see it. And again this is a post rc change. Though we are allowed to bring up this problem and **discuss as a team** what we think are critical bugs and we agree to fix in RC.\n\nThe **point** of a **rc** is to not change anything except **critical** bugs.\n\n> OK, I am back from the holiday. @Carreau are you around tomorrow to chat about this?\n\nUntil January 5th it will be really hard for me to find time. I'll be literally on the road from 31st morning to 5th night (European time), plus some packing to do before. I might be able to find some time 29 Morning (PST), 30th morning (PST) at usual meeting times or earlier, but that's be hard. \n\nI'll likely not be in front of a computer, but you can try to ring my french Phone, if I'm available I'll jump on hangout. \n",

    "body": "My quick take on this, after some discussions with @ellisonbg and @Carreau:\n- I personally hadn't actually noticed that the left blue borders in master weren't the same colors we had discussed in our \"D modified\" discussion in #708. They are similar enough that, until Brian pointed that fact out, I had to go and measure the RGB values to actually confirm they weren't the same, b/c on quick glance they looked close enough.\n- Re. the green border, I personally actually _like_ the current, all-around green border.  I have this week been using the notebook 'in anger' in writing long and complex notebooks, with lots of back-and-forth between command and edit mode, and I actually found the full green highlight quite useful in marking the state of being in command mode to me, without being so garish as to be annoying.   Note that I'm stating _my_ opinion here as a data point from one user, not making a decision.  It's just that we need to converge quickly on a decision so we can wrap it up, so for now it will be up to our own sense of balance between the usefulness of conveying that information with the green highlight and not going overboard.\n- Re the thin blue border on selected cells: it feels a bit inconsistent to me in that it's only on the right and not on the top/bottom, and thus it's different from every other visual element we already have (the other outlines are all complete).  And it's true that it was never part of our discussions in #708.  Now, it's not an end-of-the-world issue, but I agree that it's not great to have there, I just hadn't noticed it before.\n\nSo the question at this point is, do we hold a release over this or not? They are obviously UI issues and not core functionality bugs, but the reality is that we also have #893 that will require extra work, so I suggest that we go ahead and polish this up since we can, while that nasty problem gets sorted out...  \n\nIf we were literally about to pull the trigger on a release and it came down only to these issues, we might think differently about it, but given that making these changes is probably a tiny PR with:\n- Removal of the little blue right-border.\n- [Optionally] change the blue shades to the ones from the #708 discussion.\n\nThat's probably very doable.\n\nWe can then ask on-list about the green outline for cmd mode.  As I said, I'd be personally quite happy leaving it as-is as I like this version. But others might disagree, and if consensus is strongly in the opposite direction, I have no problem with that.\n\nHow does this sound?  I suspect that #893 will give us plenty of time to do the above before cutting an actual release anyway...\n",

I got tripped by mis-measuring colors on an old screenshot and got side-tracked, the point is that when we finished up the #708 discussion, we'd agreed on implementing something that would look roughly like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/57394/12047312/49f8185a-ae7e-11e5-8229-4d1bda633722.png)\n\nI actually do still like that original choice (which was our common consensus) better than what we do have in master right now.  I admit that I wasn't paying close enough attention to notice the difference, but looking at them side by side and going over the original #708 discussion, and considering that this was the choice that we ultimately converged on, I do think that it would make more sense to go with that option.\n",
