In Jupyter's current MathJax configuration, MathJax does not support MathML input at all.\n\nAs @rgbkrk noted, kernels wanting to use MathML directly can only do this on Firefox. Most browsers (including Chrome, which had MathML support but killed it some time ago) do not support MathML directly (see the MathML column under https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Web_technology_support) and thus need MathJax to convert MathML to something they can render (e.g. CSS and HTML). Even on Firefox, MathJax may add certain MathML features that Firefox's native MathML renderer does not support (see https://www.mathjax.org/mathjax-2-0-and-the-default-rendering-in-firefox/).\n\nSo, in short, Jupyter kernels wanting to output MathML need the change proposed in this PR.\n",

MathML differentiates between presentation markup (https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter3.html) and content markup (https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter4.html) and MathJax, as far as I know, currently focuses on supporting presentation markup. A short description on the two markup styles can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/MathML/Element/semantics. That's why `<semantics>` is optional and you can also pass in something like:\n\n```\n<math mode=\"display\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n  <mrow>\n        <msqrt>\n          <msup>\n            <mi>b</mi>\n            <mn>2</mn>\n          </msup>\n        </msqrt>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n```\n\nThis is `<semantics>` (i.e. presentation) content and understood as such by MathJax, but not tagged as such.\n",
