The default behaviour of setuptools, which is a major cause of headaches\n2. The behaviour of plain distutils, which may not do everything you want.\n\nWe've mostly held out from requiring setuptools, so with our projects you'll mostly get 2. However, we generally now consider pip the correct way to install packages, so in a sense you're just running into the modern systems.\n\n> With --no-deps, the dependencies are still recorded, giving errors at run-time instead of build-time.\n\nObviously if they are really hard dependencies, you're going to get errors at run time if they're not installed. But if you're getting entry point scripts which use pkg_resources and check for dependencies, I would _strongly_ recommend upgrading to a newer version of pip. Modern versions no longer create those setuptools-style entry points.\n",
