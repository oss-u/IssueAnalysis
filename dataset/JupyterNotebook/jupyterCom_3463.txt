It's the only one I've seen that works at all.  For my use case, however, the display of the originating MD cell isn't really workable.  I'm trying to create presentations with significant textual content -- not just code dumps, as is typically done with Jupyter/reveal.js slide shows -- and would love to be able to templatize them (not to mention, integrate with RISE to allow for live code execution).  In that context, I'd really love for the reveal.js slide output to hide the originating slide.  Not sure if that's possible (it looks like SoS notebooks don't play nice with reveal.js output in the first place) but I just figured I'd mention it.  I'd imagine I'm not the only one looking for this functionality.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

    "body": "There are different types of \"hide input\".\r\n\r\nThe first type is hiding input in the notebook interface as in the case of markdown cell, which was requested in https://github.com/vatlab/markdown-kernel/issues/2 with no proper solution yet. The problem is that `markdown-kernel` is just a kernel and it needs help from a frontend extension to hide input. Then there are classic jupyter and jupyterlab, both have their own set of \"hide input\" stuff. For example, [hide input](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/hide_input) is a popular extension for classic jupyter, and jupyterlab has extensive features for hiding cell input and output. It is therefore arguable if `markdown-kernel` should introduce yet another mechanism to hide input.\r\n\r\nThe second type is hiding input in the nbconvert output, typically in HTML format. SoS Notebook provides a number of [templates](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook/tree/master/src/sos_notebook/templates) that uses cell tags to control the output of cell content, so this case is covered.\r\n\r\nYou seem to need yet another type of hide input, namely hide input for presentation. I frankly have no experience with this and do not know what would be required. You meantioned that `reveal.js` does not work well with SoS Notebook so please register a ticket at either [`sos-notebook`](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook/issues) or [`markdown-kernel`](https://github.com/vatlab/markdown-kernel) so that we can have a look.",
