    "body": "@minrk - thank you for taking a look at this PR and you comment/question.  @lresende is correct - this PR eliminates the need for the NB2KG server extension, yet either Gateway instance (running at `--gateway-url`) is still required.\r\n\r\nWhere this will also be of great benefit is for enabling JupyterHub to launch gateway-destined notebooks - enabling those kernels to be launched against managed clusters.  By significantly reducing the _barrier to ~~entry~~ gateway_ we increase user options without having to understand what NB2KG is or that it even exists.\r\n\r\nRegarding the usability of server extensions, I think NB2KG tends to be different from other extensions in that it requires at least one configurable item itself - the url at which the destination gateway resides - in addition to the class mapping overrides for the three *Manager classes that proxy the kernel management.  These two aspects tend to trip up users, and that's assuming they've pip-installed the extension and it's been registered/enabled successfully.  So, although I'm not familiar with other server extensions, I'm guessing the \"configuration\" required for NB2KG is unique.  This may be more due to the fact that this is truly performing server-side operations at lower than normal levels. ",

I think Extensions being able to register various Manager classes has come up before, and might be something we could explore (i.e. users would only enable the extension, and then the extension would be responsible for instantiating the managers, which I believe is not possible now).
