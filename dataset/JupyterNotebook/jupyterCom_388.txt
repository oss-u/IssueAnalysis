IT had set the \"Start In\" location of the IPython Notebook launcher that comes as part of the Anaconda package to be an admin location for testing and then pushed it to users (without changing the \"Start In\" location).  Changing the \"Start In\" location to a path where users could write seems to have fixed things.  I'm still confused because \n- when creating a notebook from the dashboard (using the admin \"Start In\" location), the notebook was created but I could not open it\n- I could not open notebooks if I launched the dashboard from the command line in my Documents directory\n- using a virtual environment did not seem to help\n\nUnless the notebook is inheriting the \"Start In\" location in some way, I'm not sure why it would affect each use case described.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a user error, Anaconda, or notebook error.  Feel free to close this issue or do with it what you see fit.\n\nThanks for all the hard work!\n",
