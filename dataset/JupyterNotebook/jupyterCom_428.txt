What is our typical response to the user on what to do?\n\nThat we are aware, and even self signed is better than no certificate at all if you don't want people to snoop or modify what information on the wire.\n\n> Are both the .rst file or the .ipynb documents being used by users to create and use a cert? Or is one doc a legacy doc and the other the doc that will be used going forward?\n\nI think the rst is older. I think we can keep the `.ipynb` I just want to make sure all the info is on the one we keep whichever you think is fit. \n\n@rgbkrk, @minrk any other thoughts on that ? \n",
