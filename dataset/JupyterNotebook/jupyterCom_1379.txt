Wait for the `Connection failed` message to appear in the UI. By then, the console should show WebSocket connection to kernel failed and that it's retrying.\n6. Reestablish network connectivity.\n7. Console should say that kernel_connected.\n8. Click OK in `Connection failed` dialogue.\n9. Observe that disconnected icon is still in the status bar and cell is still supposedly executing.\n10. New cell cannot be executed (maybe the frontend thinks the first cell hasn't finished execution and there's no way for the frontend to reconcile the state?)\n11.
