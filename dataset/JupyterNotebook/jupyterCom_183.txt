I'm not sure exactly what `logspace(-3,+3)` is.  Are you saying you want the labels and values on the slider to change?  Could a slider that takes arbitrary text labels and associated values work?\n\nEdit: I just ried `logspace(-3,+3)` in Julia, and it gave back an array of values presumably equally spaced with respect to log.  In Sage, we had the concept of a continuous and discrete sliders, and a discrete slider would take a list of values.  Would a discrete slider (i.e., just take a list of values) be sufficient for your usecase?\n",
