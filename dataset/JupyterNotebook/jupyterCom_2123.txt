I did not experience any inconsistencies. \r\nOf course the notebook still becomes dirty as soon as the first cell is executed, which is the correct behavior. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to delay the start of the kernel until the execution of the first cell, since as far as I can tell, the kernel seems to be not used for simply displaying the notebook? However, this might lead to a delay, when the user executes the first cell.",
