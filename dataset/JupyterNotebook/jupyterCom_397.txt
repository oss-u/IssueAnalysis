We could give the reverse priority a try if we want to enforce that `/path/to/jupyter kernelspec` is identical to `/path/to/jupyter-kernelspec`. I don't see a good way to accomplish what @resurgo is trying to do without that. At the same time, using PATH to override/wrap commands would not be possible if we made that change.

    "body": ":) - got it. Read the doc before asking dumb question. Sorted now on bs4.\r\n\r\nI have run `jupyter kernelspec list' from bash and get \r\n\r\n`Available kernels:\r\n  python2    /Users/Chris/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python2\r\n  python3    /Users/Chris/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python3`\r\n\r\n(note - I had originally created the kernels after installing Anaconda follwing the advice at the page you mentioned, long before I discoverd this thread. -  [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html)\r\n\r\nBut it's possible that I had tried both methods (under the 'kernels for Python2 and 3' headers), for both Python 2 and 3. All in the midst of multiple installs and uninstalls of both anaconda and Python3 (using Homebrew). So it's probably all a bit of a mess.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do to align Jupyter with the bash interpreter environments?\r\nThanks\r\n",
