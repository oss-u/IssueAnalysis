The thing about just invoking the python in the correct location is that anything else may use the wrong scripts since the path isn't set correctly.\n\nBy the way, I think `defaultkernel` is a terrible name, but I do think that making it very easy to have a user start up a notebook in an environment with the assumption that the python running the notebook will also run the kernel will lower the barrier a lot.\n",

    "body": "The notebook no longer relies on IPython, which provides one of many kernels. For convenience the notebook does, however, add the IPython kernel for the notebook server's env _if no Python kernel is already registered_. That IF is the source of frustration, if you want to be doing it all the time, though. The idea being that changing the env of the notebook server _should not_ change the env of your kernels. Similarly, making an env with a kernel doesn't require installing the notebook in that env, just the kernel. This is my habit - I frequently make envs and install IPython in them, and register a kernelspec for the env. What I don't do is install the notebook server multiple times.\n\nWe could also make the in-env kernel available unconditionally with a _different_ name, though. It's more special treatment of IPython than we wanted, but it may be appropriate to put this behavior back.\n\nThere's another hack you can do, and I'm not sure if/how we can make it more convenient to do so: Change the absolute path for Python in the kernel.json to just `python` instead of `/path/to/bin/python3`. If you do this, the kernel will always use the first `python` on PATH in the notebook server's process, which is generally the env's Python.\n",
