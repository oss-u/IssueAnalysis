But you wouldn't see the \"View\" button for other things.\r\n\r\nAnd by image types, I was only referring to jpg/png, not svg, which is definitely text and can be edited just fine. Right now if you \"edit\" a jpg or png, it opens the text editor, but it fails with an encoding error. If a user says \"Edit this jpg file\" that is a disappointing and confusing outcome...\r\n\r\n@takluyver I agree that getting the raw text of a text file using \"View\" would be useful, but that doesn't work right now. The View button only shows (as far as I can tell) for HTML files. So actually, the current behavior actually matches my preference (View only shows for HTML files).\r\n\r\nSo I think the only change I would like is to not show the \"Edit\" button for the `image/png` and `image/jpeg` file types.",

We had many issues with windows reporting css as `application/css` instead of `test/css`. Starting to black/whitelist is a rats nest. jpeg ? or jpg?  or JPEG ? What if photoshop is installed ? Then it will appear as a photoshop file. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the button at the top are advanced action, by default clicking on the links will do the right thing (hopefully). And removing either edit (or view) has IMHO more chance of annoying advanced users than to really be annoying for newcomers, and I think that Jupyter have mostly been about allowing users to do arbitrary things, and that would go the opposite way.

Maybe use an alert when you click edit to say \"Hey, I think this is a binary file, are you sure?\", but removing the edit button seem a little drastic to me.\r\n\r\nMIME types, accepted extensions, unaccepted extensions (or even other suggestions like binaryornot) all seem to be making the decision for me, when I'd rather decide if I want to be able to click edit or not.

Even if I'm only 1% of 1%.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nI can work around this by adding a bookmark with `javascript:$('.edit-button').css('display', 'inline-block')` and clicking it every time I want to edit a file that was determined to not be editable.
