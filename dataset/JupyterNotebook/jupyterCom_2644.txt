    "body": "One justification behind this was I was pretty keen to be able to work on writing a jupyterlab extension, have the extension hosted using a webpack dev server, and have the notebook server running in an \"allow origin\" mode from the webpack dev server.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to develop a jupyterlab extension and have the web browser automatically update as I write. Is there another way people have been achieving this during jupyterlab development?\r\n\r\nI figured all I would need to do is boot up the notebook server with allow origins (and headers + methods), then update the jupyterlab settings services to point to the notebook server port. That way I can go to town with the benefits of the webpack dev server. Benefits such as webpack building everything directly in RAM instead of on disk and then via change detection rebuilding the necessary parts very quickly, and then auto refreshing the page. It makes development very nice. I figured it was worth trying to get up and running for the purpose of writing my extension.",
