The only proper test for whether `os.rename` will work is to try it and observe any error codes.  So, conceivably another path here would be to try the `send2trash` and if it fails, just hard delete the file.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the use of a raw, unconditional `os.rename` by `send2trash` is simply wrong, especially in 2020.\r\n\r\nI'm looking into the config setting, which I hope will work here.  Thanks!",
