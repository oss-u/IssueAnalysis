    "body": "Mmm, ok, I think I follow. This whole issue got rapidly confusing for me, as `@` is a reserved character of gen-delim type in URIs, along with `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `[`, and `]`\n(see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-12), and as such it shouldn't be used in components of a scheme which rely on it as a delimiter. The subtlety which I had missed is that whether it's used as a delimiter _depends on the scheme in use_. Trying to decide which delimiters were ok and which weren't eventually led me to [this SO question/answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2366260/whats-valid-and-whats-not-in-a-uri-query) which finally cleared it up for me: `@` _is_ ok in http[s] scheme URLs, even though it may not be ok in URIs for other schemes, depending on how those schemes use it.\n\nI ran into this as a problem when building testing for extensions, and presumably got confused over [`encodeURI`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI) vs [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent), as the former doesn't escape the `@`, while the latter (as used in `utils. encode_uri_components` in [notebook/static/base/js/utils.js#L541](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/4e359c921fb503ba3782a67cbd5ed221b081a478/notebook/static/base/js/utils.js#L541)) does.\n\nI guess it might make the intent a little clearer to add an escaped character as well...\n",
