Do I need to create a new branch to push my changes in (for ex. \"bidi\" branch)?\r\n\r\nYou likely want to always submit your work against master (that's the default GitHub configuration so that should be easy), but the exact branch you push your work to, does not really matter. You should anyway be able to push only on your fork. The only limiting factor is you need at least one branch per opened Pull Request. So if you are sure to always have only one PR \"in flight\" then you can always use the same \"bidi\" branch. Otherwise you can push things with different name like `bidi-fix-calendar`, and `bidi-fix-numeral` for example, that what I would do.\r\n\r\nAlso, just as a tip, we tend to not check messages on close issues/merged PR, so if we don't respond feel free to open a new issue.  If you have any other questions about git feel free to ask. \r\n",
