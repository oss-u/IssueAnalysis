    "body": "If your software is running on the asyncio event loop, it's feasible to\nstart not only a kernel, but also a notebook server, all inside the same\nprocess. The bummer is if anything blocks, ever, it will block everything.\nThreads _might_ solve this. If it's not in the event loop (or a different\none, e.g. qt) it would be a lot harder.\n\nGetting a new server is pretty easy from inside an ipykernel.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/bollwyvl/bd56b58ba0a078534272043327c52bd1\n\nA lot of the complexity is around logging, but the first couple cells do\nthe job.\n\nIt would then need to start a kernel, and overload the kernel session\nmachinery to service requests in-loop. I have no example of this, and the\nchance for deadlock becomes very real.\n\nLess hacky:  wrap the other way, where you allow the notebook server to\nstart as normal, and treat your application as a kernel.\n\nhttps://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wrapperkernels.html\n\nI'd probably recommend that approach, as you can repurpose 95% of ipython,\nwhich is probably what you want, and work with all kinds of clients.\n\nIf you're ready for jupyterlab 3, you might be able to use xeus-python and\nthe debugger, which might be even better for your users.\n\nWhichever route you take, it would make a great blog post!\n",
