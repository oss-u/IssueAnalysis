After killing the server and restarting from terminal `import ROOT` reliably worked. \n\nafter fiddling some more with terminal I could reproduce the crash being caused by \nabsence of:\n`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib/root:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`\nso the issue is not with Jupyter.\n\n@minrk, thank you  for the hint with the terminal. This should be the preferred way to start servers.\nI'd consider issue closed.\n",
