    "body": "@ellisonbg it's most likely that it was putting outputs on the page that was the real cost (especially if the symptom was a hung browser) rather than the network traffic, since the way we append stream output is _extremely_ inefficient. This is the primary issue addressed in the js side of #506. If the network is slow or clogged, that should actually make it _harder_ to crash the browser.\n\nI think the scalable approach is to dump excess output to files on the server side, but that adds some peculiarities, since output is part of the kernel API, not necessarily related to notebooks (e.g. thebe has no file or path associated with the output messages). Because of this, it seems to me like overflow truncation should look like:\n1. part of the Kernels service\n2. overflowed output is associated with kernels, with a file per parent (i.e. output area)\n3. overflowed output is only accessible while the kernel exists, and is deleted on shutdown of the kernel and/or server\n4. On overflow, OutputArea presents a control that allows one-time, explicit \"Yes I want this\" fetch of overflowed output into the notebook.\n\nIf we want this really scalable, the only _true_ answer is for notebooks to actually be multiple files, so we don't have to read the whole thing at once, and can scroll within outputs, having only a limited amount of content available in memory at a time. I don't think this is feasible with the current notebook format, though.\n",

Where would you put it? When, if ever, would you clean it up? If it's associated with a notebook (it isn't in the APIs), then this isn't so hard, because it can be cleaned up on clear-output and should reside next to the notebook. Since notebooks are really single files, when we have side files associated with notebooks (as opposed to kernels) like this, we need to add logic for handling them to file delete/rename/copy/checkpoint/restore/etc.\n> \n> But I will reiterate that it's putting a large amount of output on the page that ~always causes the problem. Its mere existence, either in the notebook json or in memory, has a much higher bar for causing trouble if it isn't being displayed.\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n",
