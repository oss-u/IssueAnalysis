    "body": "@jasongrout @SylvainCorlay @gnestor have all been working *really* hard getting ready for for the 6.0 release of ipywidgets. Some aspects of this release as it relates to notebook releases:\r\n\r\n* Regardless of when notebook 5.0 comes out, we will need to release a 4.4 with the ipywidget fixes. Too many folks are still running notebook 4.x to not have latest ipywidgets work on it.\r\n* I think we are still a few weeks away from a 5.0 notebook release (see #2150).\r\n* Releasing 4.4 should be much work as there hasn't been much work.\r\n\r\n@gnestor can you take the lead on a 4.4 release? I opened an issue to discuss the 4.4 release #2161",
