And calling a defined python function from javascript, in my case, does not work either, because the data I need comes only from javascript (is a json object), and I'll have to pass it as a parameter to the function, which is the same thing that storing it into a python var. \n\n*_Update: *_\n@takluyver: In the example I did, you're right, the num var is being modified. But my case is a little more complex, but I've realized that what I'm doing is not too efficient since it is not a simple number, but it could be billions of data rows, so I'll have to drop this solution and close this issue.
