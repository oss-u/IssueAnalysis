    "body": "I figured this out by myself. I have a mac, here is what I did:\r\n\r\nopen the ~/.bash_profile (you might have it in the ~/.bashrc) in the terminal, then change the path for python in this file\r\n\r\nPATH=\"/Users/zwj/anaconda3/bin:${PATH}.\"\r\nexport PATH\r\n\r\nIf you had two different versions, you can use 'which' command to find the corresponding path, eg\r\nwhich python2\r\nwhich python\r\nwhich python3\r\n\r\nMy python 3.6.7 is in /Users/zwj/anaconda3/bin/python, python 3.7.5 is in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3.7. The original path in my .bash_profile is the path for 3.7.5, after I changed the path in this file, my current notebook is using python3.6.\r\n\r\nHope it is helpful to people who had the same issue.",
