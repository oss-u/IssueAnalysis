Do you mean that we shouldn't have the discussion?\n\nIIRC there was a PR to add the keyboard manager to the file browser so\nadding it to the text editor would also make sense? I didn't realize that\nmenus were not yet using actions. My logic about the commad pallette is\nthat as we move to a single page app where there are many different\ncomponents on a page, having a command pallette would be very useful - even\nfor non-notebook components.\n\nOn Sat, Aug 15, 2015 at 8:36 AM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I didn't see a standard keyboard shortcut or Edit menu item for this.\n> \n> We can bikeshed on that in another smaller PR.\n> It is \"a very common action\" but no-one was able to use it for the past 4\n> years, so it can wait a week.\n> I would prefer to land that and test it quick then someone can decide on\n> icon and menu naming later.\n> \n> Also, what would it take to enable this and the command palette on the\n> text editor page as well?\n> \n> What would be the point ?
