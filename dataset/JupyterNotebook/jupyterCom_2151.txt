I took a look at https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/setupbase.py#L345-L377 and it looks like it's running `npm install` based on whether `node_modules` exists and  whether the created time of `node_modules` is older than the `package.json`. That sounds right... 🤔\r\n\r\nLet's close this issue because it's resolved and keep an eye on https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2056 for any other reports. Hopefully it's just an edge case affecting upgrades of dev installs.",
