    "body": "Hi @iqrajaved1 - thank you for opening this pull request.  However, we cannot accept it in this form as it is not updating the documentation in the proper way.  If you feel there should be documentation regarding how kernels are shutdown, as well as the notebook server in general, a location within the existing documentation should be located and improved with appropriate information.\r\n\r\nI haven't scanned the existing documentation (located in [docs/source](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/master/docs/source)) to see if this information already exists, but I can reference the CLI command `jupyter notebook list` (to list running servers) and `jupyter notebook stop` (to stop running servers).  Also, note that stopping a notebook server will result in the server attempting to stop any currently running kernels prior to its shutdown.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this pull request but we welcome documentation updates.  Here's some information on our [contributing guidelines](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#contributing-to-the-jupyter-notebook).",
