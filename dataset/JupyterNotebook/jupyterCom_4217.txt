Do you think that the shortcut keys should have an explanation or are you set on leaving everything as an uppercase letter?\r\nI am working on some bugs (and this documentation \"issue\") to get an A in one of my classes and have never worked in open source. I would love to contribute and if there is anything I could do to maybe provide clarification for the shortcuts that I could send a pull request in for or if you maybe could point me in a direction of a bug that would be a good start for me. I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks.",

We're glad to have you here!\r\n\r\nI think it would be more consistent with the rest of the system to explain what the shortcuts text signifies in the documentation (i.e., that it indicates what keys to press, rather than the text to type).\r\n\r\nWhen submitting a PR, I'd also suggest mentioning which issue the PR is solving in the description so it's easier to track things.\r\n\r\nAs for other good issues, I think most issues with a \"good first issue\" label would be the ones to look at.
