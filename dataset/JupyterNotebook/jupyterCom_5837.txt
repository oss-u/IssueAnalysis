I feel that previous versions allowed recovering the previous state of a file. \r\n\r\nSince I can't reproduce this using 6.1.4, we're going to need more information, like what _previous version_ of notebook worked for you?  That would at least allow us to review changes between the two releases.\r\n\r\nOftentimes, various extensions can side-effect behavior, could you please provide the output of `jupyter nbextension list` and `jupyter serverextension list`?\r\n",
