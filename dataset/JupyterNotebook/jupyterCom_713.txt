    "body": "> I just call Image(url=path)\n\nI am not supposed to know that. You just tell me that that you are using Image, \n\nKeep in mind that `Image(<a url>)` is not the same as `Image(<a filename>)` is not the same as `Image(url=<a url>)`is not the same as `Image(filename=<a filename>)` is likely not the same as half of the other similar option, where you add the keyword `embed=True|False`. \n\nSo let's look at the doc. Non relevant part removed.\n\n``` python\nIn[2]: from IPython.display import Image\nIn[3]: Image?? \nInit signature: Image(self, data=None, url=None, filename=None, format='png', embed=None, ...)\n\nCreate a PNG/JPEG image object given raw data.\n\n...\nParameters\n----------\ndata : unicode, str or bytes\n    ...\n    This always results in embedded image data.\nurl : unicode\n    A URL to download the data from. If you specify `url=`,\n    the image data will not be embedded unless you also specify `embed=True`.\nfilename : unicode\n    ...\n    Images from a file are always embedded.\nformat : unicode\n    ...\nembed : bool\n    Should the image data be embedded using a data URI (True) or be\n    loaded using an <img> tag. Set this to True if you want the image\n    to be viewable later with no internet connection in the notebook.\n\n    Default is `True`, unless the keyword argument `url` is set, then\n    default value is `False`.\n\n    ...\nwidth : int\n    ...\nheight : int\n    ...\nretina : bool\n    ...\nunconfined: bool\n    ...\nmetadata: dict\n    ...\n\nExamples\n--------\n# embedded image data, works in qtconsole and notebook\n# when passed positionally, the first arg can be any of raw image data,\n# a URL, or a filename from which to load image data.\n# The result is always embedding image data for inline images.\nImage('http://www.google.fr/images/srpr/logo3w.png')\nImage('/path/to/image.jpg')\nImage(b'RAW_PNG_DATA...')\n\n# Specifying Image(url=...) does not embed the image data,\n# it only generates `<img>` tag with a link to the source.\n# This will not work in the qtconsole or offline.\n```\n\nSo actually we have 3 exclusive kwargs, each with 2 possiblity + embed with 3 possibility (True, False, None) that's 3_2_3 = 18 call signatures that are commonly used by our users, probably a third of which don't make sens, like if you pass a `<url>` to `filename=`.\n\nIn your case, for me, It's particularly non obvious why you load a file from disk with a `url=`, I personally would assume that from disk you use `filename=`. But you probably choose to use `url=` for a good reason after reading the documentation instead of using the default argument. I don't see how you could have chosen `url=` otherwise. So let's stick with `url=`. \n\nI still have to make assumption as to all the \"just\" in the `just call Image(url=path)` is doing:\nAs far as I understand, for `url=` to work in what seem to be your case,  you are **likely** to pass a relative path, which **by chance** should correspond to a relative url (hypothesis A). Your also likely to not have changed directory in your notebook (hypothesis B), or you would get a 404. I make these 2 hypothesis because I don't want to enumerate all the other possibilities and (sub) possibilities. \n\nSo you're not setting `embed` despite passing another kwarg which is not the first. \n(Sorry if you are in an older version of IPython that document the existence of `url=` and not `embed=`). That's means it default to `None`: when using  `url=` it's equivalent to `embed=False` according the the function docstring, so you are not embedding, and you are actually passing a relative path, which is interpreted as a relative url, which by chance works because you haven't changed working directory. So when you re-exec you are hitting browser caching. So there is nothing we can do.\n\nThis conclusion only hold if (Hypothesis A) and (Hypothesis B) holds, otherwise I'm not sure what's happening. (Hypothesis A) is also unlikely if you are not on a unix-based machine because of `os.sep`, though we, and windows too do go through complex mechanisme to allow forward slashes in path names. \n\nHope that would give you enough information to determine the cause with certainty, I personally don't have sufficient knowledge of what you are doing to give a judgement with 100% certainty. \n\nThanks. \n",
