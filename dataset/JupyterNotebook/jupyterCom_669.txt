The set at the top of the queue is given its own special UI indicator (I was suggesting something that contrasts with the actual selection colors like red, though I know that might have other bad connotations), and it is that set of cells to which the function will be applied. \n\nThe idea let's you choose to step through the queue by using some kind of toggle/step-through key (based on gmail's mechanism for stepping through different inboxes I suggested  <code>`</code> , but then @Carreau let me know that that won't work for non-US keyboards :-1:), and that will toggle which cells will have actions applied to them as a separate idea from the status of marked, selected or marked and selected.\n\nsidenote: I'm assuming that actions like merging are just going to be disabled for noncontiguous blocks of cells? Otherwise the semantics of what it is to merge get wonky…\n",

The way that I've been thinking about it is:\n- With the exception of switching into edit mode, and marking/unmarking cells, all other actions are only ever applied to marked cells. The state of being marked is indicated by a bar to the left of the cell.\n- In order to choose a cell that you want to edit, or to mark/unmark individual cells, you have a cursor. If the cursor is on a cell, then that cell is counted as marked and thus has a bar to the left of it as well.\n- However, when the cursor is on a cell, while that cell is counted as marked, it is not a \"sticky\" mark, e.g. it will go away if you focus on another cell. So you can explicitly mark the cell, but then you need a way of visually distinguishing cells that are focused that have do or do not have a sticky mark.\n\nSo, essentially, it should be possible to determine from a screenshot (without knowing the history of actions) which of the following categories each cell falls under:\n- Focused/selected (with a \"sticky\" mark)\n- Focused/selected (without a \"sticky\" mark)\n- Not selected and marked\n- Not selected and unmarked\n",
