    "body": "@minrk I have a `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js` file that listens for the `app_initialized.NotebookApp` event and do some stuffs, like so:\n\n``` js\ndefine(['base/js/events'], function(events) {\n    events.on('app_initialized.NotebookApp', function() {\n        ...\n    });\n});\n```\n\nAfter upgrading `notebook` to `4.2.2` the event handler is not being called anymore and I am not sure why. My thinking is that by reversing the order the nbconfig is loaded, the `app_initialized.NotebookApp` event is being fired before my `custom.js` code is loaded.\n\nDoes this make sense? Is there a better place to listen for `app_initialized.NotebookApp`?\n",
