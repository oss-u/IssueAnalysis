    "body": "Do an `import sys` , `sys.executable`. \n\nThe interpreter that run the notebook is **likely** different than the one that run the **kernel**. \n\n`frameworkpython -m jupyter notebook` is roughly useless as you run the jupyter command with `frameworkpython`, it shells out, so the interpreter of notebook can perfectly be not the framework one (and heck the notebook could be written in go you wouldn't notice) , then it's start the kernel which could again be in another language or interpreter.\n\nYou **likely** want to do : \n\n```\n$ frameworkpython -m ipykernel install --name 'frameworkpython'\n```\n\n to get a new available frameworkpython kernel, or just drop the `--name 'frameworkpython'` to replace the default python kernel. Using `%matplotlib inline`  might also help as then it does not try to use the osx backend. \n",
