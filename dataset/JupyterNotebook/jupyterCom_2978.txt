    "body": "Hi @Gateway2745  - thank for your question.\r\n\r\nYou can't configure notebook to use passwords and auto-generated tokens.  To get the dual behavior you want, you'll need to configure a fixed token in the configuration file.  This enables either a password or a token to be entered at login, or you can formulate a URL with the token parameters `?token=<configured-token>`.\r\n\r\nYour configuration file entries should resemble something akin to:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"NotebookApp\": {\r\n    \"password\": \"sha1:65e37f0d14de:5249cef964e888cf5b8f9cc99c8735e01c8e0f2f\",\r\n    \"token\": \"10fd01baf5c7ff2db46cb937e42e1da8d19bd49023216e2b\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nApplication startup should present an elipsis for the token...\r\n```\r\n[I 07:39:51.750 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=...\r\n[I 07:39:51.750 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...\r\n[I 07:39:51.750 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\r\n```\r\nYet, `jupyter notebook list` will display the token, and indicate passwords are enabled:\r\n```json\r\n{\"base_url\": \"/\", \"hostname\": \"localhost\", \"notebook_dir\": \"/Users/kbates/notebooks\", \"password\": true, \"pid\": 49369, \"port\": 8888, \"secure\": false, \"token\": \"10fd01baf5c7ff2db46cb937e42e1da8d19bd49023216e2b\", \"url\": \"http://localhost:8888/\"}\r\n```\r\nI'm going to close this issue since its quite old and no changes have been implied.  We can re-open should we find that necessary, but a new issue would probably be the suggested approach at that time.  Thank you.",
