    "body": "@mgeier Welcome! Nice to see the friendly face of  the `nbsphinx` project here. I'm sorry for the development installation goosechase. You are absolutely correct that we need to simplify and centralize the development installation. Thanks for your offer to help with a PR, and we will take you up on your offer.\n\n@captainsafia Thanks for giving me the heads up. Since you are more familiar with the Javascript process and plans, would you mind guiding @mgeier on any questions and/or insights for upcoming changes?\n\nHere's my current thinking (though I am open to other suggestions) about what would be helpful.\nFirst, as an aside, @mgeier, there are two repos that we'll be working with jupyter/jupyter and jupyter/notebook. Safia, I would like to view the jupyter/jupyter repo as a general umbrella for all Project Jupyter development, and jupyter/notebook repo as docs specific to the Notebook.\n\nI'm leaning toward keeping general code contribution info in the guide that Safia mentions in jupyter/jupyter. We can add general JS tips for setting up a dev environment there (my assumption here is that these tips would be helpful whether working on the notebook, widgets, extensions, or future projects. \n\nIn the jupyter/notebook repo, let's put notebook development installation specifics to get up and running. This document would be the definitive \"how to install a dev environment for the notebook\". After this is done, we can link the CONTRIBUTORS doc and README, as well as the code contribution guide in jupyter/jupyter, to it.\n\nAs a work plan,  we can divide and conquer:\n\n_Changes for jupyter/notebook repo_\n- [ ] Rename Development Documentation to Contributor Documentation\n- [ ] Clean up the [Development Intro Index](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/development_intro.rst) which leads to a confusing repetition of topics in the sidebar\n- [ ] Expand and edit the [Installing JS machinery](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/development_js.rst) so it has the detailed instructions of setting up a development environment for the Notebook.\n- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTOR and README\n\n_Changes for jupyter/jupyter repo_\n- [ ] Add tips on general JS development\n- [ ] We're probably at the point where we can begin linking to the Contributor Documentation in individual repos. Perhaps a one page doc that links out to the Contributor Documentation sections of each project's docs.\n\nThoughts? Comments? :cookie: :cookie:\n",

    "body": "OK, here comes a first bunch of questions. I've numbered them for easier answering ...\n1. In the current docs I found 3 links about general guidelines for contributing. Which of the following should I use?\n   - https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n   - http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contrib_guide_code.html\n   - http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/#contributor-documentation\n2. Is `python setup.py js css` necessary _initially_ when running `pip install -e .`?\n   If yes, before or after?\n3. Is the Debian/Ubuntu package `python-dev`/`python3-dev` necessary?\n   IOW, does anything have to be compiled?\n   BTW, should we suggest to install `python3-tornado` and `python3-jinja2` with the package manager (instead of implicitly with pip)?\n4. The FreeBSD instructions seem outdated (using Python 2.7 and `requirements.txt` which doesn't seem to exist anymore.\n   Also, the instructions mostly just show how to use a virtualenv, which doesn't seem FreeBSD-specific to me.\n   I don't know anything about FreeBSD, who can update the instructions?\n   Or shall we just drop them?\n5. Should `python setup.py jsdeps` be documented?\n   AFAICT, this is always called automatically, right?\n   What about the `-f` flag? Shall we document that?\n   Apart from that, the command raises an error if I try to use it:\n   \n   ```\n   $ python3 setup.py jsdeps\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"setup.py\", line 199, in <module>\n      main()\n    File \"setup.py\", line 196, in main\n      setup(**setup_args)\n    File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/distutils/core.py\", line 134, in setup\n      ok = dist.parse_command_line()\n    File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/distutils/dist.py\", line 472, in parse_command_line\n      args = self._parse_command_opts(parser, args)\n    File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/distutils/dist.py\", line 544, in _parse_command_opts\n      raise DistutilsClassError(msg % cmd_class)\n   distutils.errors.DistutilsClassError: command class <class 'setupbase.JavascriptDependencies'> must provide 'user_options' attribute (a list of tuples)\n   ```\n6. Is building the docs documented somewhere?\n7. How is `make.bat` supposed to be used?\n   Wouldn't it be better to use a platform-independent `python setup.py build_sphinx`?\n   This is probably worth a separate issue ...\n",

    "body": "1. I don't think those are mutually exclusive. The first is supposed to have a short summary, the third is a more detailed set of contribution docs, and the second is part of the third.\n2. I believe that `pip install -e .` should run the css & js builds automatically, so `python setup.py css js` is only needed later on when you've updated master or changed the code yourself.\n3. The -dev packages are needed if installing pyzmq from pip, which will have to build it from source. In general, I probably wouldn't recommend people get deps from apt, because they may be out of date (especially for users on Ubuntu 14.04), and the instructions have to change slightly between Python 3 and Legacy Python.\n4. The FreeBSD instructions probably are out of date. I think a FreeBSD user stopped by at one point during the big refactoring and added them. I'd prefer to try to make as much of the instructions as possible platform-neutral.\n5. I think that command should be automatically called when necessary, so let's leave it undocumented for now.\n6. Not sure. @willingc , any description of how to build the docs?\n7. When you set up Sphinx docs, it creates `Makefile` for Unix platforms and `make.bat` for Windows platforms. We ~always build the docs from Unix, so I've never looked into `make.bat`, but I assume Windows users who are familiar with Sphinx will know what to do, so we leave it in place. Sphinx does already provide a cross-platform `sphinx-build` command, but I don't know what options it needs off the top of my head. I don't think we should start trying to build custom solutions here - if you want to improve that infrastructure, that's something to do in Sphinx.\n",

    "body": "@mgeier Here are a few more points. Thanks @takluyver for the responses :smile:\n1. I think all of the links that you mentioned could be used. It would depend on the context of how you are using them. The first is the IPython Contributor guidelines which are still used by IPython and in many cases the culture for Jupyter as well. The second is the general information about contributing source code to a Jupyter project; while the third gives information on the many ways that individuals may contribute to the projects.\n2. I believe @takluyver is correct that you do not technically have to run `python setup.py js css` after the initial installation. It is required to be used when the JS/CSS/LESS files are changed.\n3. Agree with @takluyver here. In general I would recommend pip (or conda) over using the OS package managers since many of the OS package managers use dated versions. Please use pip for tornado and jinja2.\n4. I think the FreeBSD should be removed from the README. I'm ok with it being in the developer documentation though I wonder if it is really necessary.\n5. Let's not mention or if you feeling strongly that there is a reason to mention, I'm cool with a sentence on it that mentions it is automatically called.\n6. The general contribution guide has a section that explains [how to contribute to the docs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contrib_guide_docs.html). For now, I would just refer people to there.\n7. I would prefer to keep it simple on this. For now, let's just refer to the general contribution guide for docs for most cases (people adding content) that will be sufficient. \n\nThanks for all the thoughtful questions. Feel free when you are ready to open a WIP PR. I imagine that there will be more specific questions :smile:\n",

    "body": "@takluyver, @willingc Thanks for your responses!\n\nI've created a PR: #1208.\n1. I used only http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/#contributor-documentation, because even if it doesn't contain all the relevant information from the other two yet, it definitely should. And I'm trying to simplify things here ...\n   Also, [Jupyter on your system](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/system.html) should not be part of the \"contributor documentation\". I don't have the energy right now to create issues for that, let alone PRs.\n2. OK, that's good to know. I moved it from the initial build steps to another section.\n3. I followed your suggestion to use pip to install the dependencies, but I mentioned the OS packages for people like me who prefer to install OS packages for those.\n4. I removed the FreeBSD stuff\n5. I removed the \"jsdeps\" stuff\n6. I added step-by-step instructions and linked to the Project Jupyter docs\n7. I just clumsily mentioned `make.bat`, since I'm not a Windows user either\n\n@takluyver said about `python setup.py build_sphinx`:\n\n> I don't think we should start trying to build custom solutions here - if you want to improve that infrastructure, that's something to do in Sphinx.\n\nI'm not at all suggesting a custom solution, on the contrary!  That command should run out-of-the-box with `setuptools` if Sphinx is installed. This would automatically make everything cross platform and would actually be much simpler than handling the bulky `Makefile`. But since you are a `setuptools` hater I guess this will never happen, right?\nOr shall I make an Issue for that?\n\nJust as a side note: I think it was a ridiculous choice of the Sphinx people to force the ugly `Makefile` and `make.bat` onto its users instead of providing reasonable command line options to `sphinx-build`. Actually `sphinx-build` can nowadays be quite easily used, see http://nbsphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html#Running-Sphinx.\nBut `setuptools` would make this even easier!\n",

I know that I, personally, take pause when he comments on things. We don't always entirely agree but I respect his viewpoint. More often than not, Jupyter benefits since merging our ideas together usually improves the end result.\n\nSo, let's keep iterating here :smiley:\n\nAs an FYI re: pip3, the recent versions of pip eliminate the need for using pip3.\n",

Python2 users just have to drop the \"3\".\n3. `python3 -m pip install ...`: should work on all systems. Python2 users just have to drop the \"3\".\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I like the last option. It looks a bit awkward at first, but I think I can get over that.\n\nIt has several advantages:\n- It is a clear statement that Python 3 should be used\n- It is easy to experiment with different Python version, e.g. `python3.4` vs `python3.5`\n- Many commands in the docs will look more consistent when using `python3 -m pip ...` and `python3 setup.py ...`\n\nThe same thing could also be used for `python3 -m venv`, but this'll have to be changed to `python -m virtualenv` for Python 2.\n",

It's not clear to me what's best for newcomers, though. My personal preference is probably for using `pip install` everywhere, and including a note at the top, explaining that in some cases `pip` may not point to the Python you want, in which case `/path/to/python -m pip` can be used to ensure packages are installed with a particular Python. I'm not sure if that's too verbose for people, though.\n\nRe: FreeBSD instructions, I do think they should be removed, and I also think that we shouldn't include instructions for setting up a virtualenv.\n",

I'm trying to summarize them here:\n\n@willingc mentioned a few things in https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193#issuecomment-195887000:\n\n> _Changes for jupyter/notebook repo_\n> - [ ] Update [...] README\n> \n> _Changes for jupyter/jupyter repo_\n> - [ ] Add tips on general JS development\n> - [ ] We're probably at the point where we can begin linking to the Contributor Documentation in individual repos. Perhaps a one page doc that links out to the Contributor Documentation sections of each project's docs.\n\nIn https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193#issuecomment-196488491, I mentioned that http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/#contributor-documentation should include the information from https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (if it doesn't already).\nThere should probably also be a link from the latter to the former.\n\nI also mentioned that [Jupyter on your system](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/system.html) should not be part of the \"contributor documentation\".\n\nIn https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193#issuecomment-196857596, I suggested to suggest this in the general Notebook installation docs (or even in the general Jupyter installation docs?):\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install python3-zmq python3-tornado\n```\n\nThen there was a very interesting discussion about making the `pip` commands more consistent, e.g.: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193#issuecomment-198765187\n\nI think using `python3 -m pip install` everywhere would be good.\nIn which context/form should this be discussed further?\n\nFinally, I'd like to continue the discussion about `python3 setup.py build_sphinx`:\n\nI said in https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1193#issuecomment-196488491:\n\n> I'm not at all suggesting a custom solution, on the contrary!  That command should run out-of-the-box with `setuptools` if Sphinx is installed. This would automatically make everything cross platform and would actually be much simpler than handling the bulky `Makefile`. But since you are a `setuptools` hater I guess this will never happen, right?\n\n@takluyver said:\n\n> I don't want to involve the packaging machinery in building docs.\n\n@willingc said:\n\n> I agree.\n\nBut why?\nAre there any practical disadvantages?\n\nBTW, in the meantime I found out that this can even be done without using `setuptools` using [sphinx.setup_command.BuildDoc](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/master/sphinx/setup_command.py). `setuptools` would just do this automatically.\n",
