I thought it would be better to have a couple more layers that are a bit clearer in their intent just so it could be understood more easily. Additionally, this should make diagnosing failure at a step a bit simpler. As the total image size ended up being the same and the build time improved, this doesn't seem to hurt.\n\nAlso, each layer is a point that someone could start a container from. If testing failed, one could try using the post-installation layer to startup and play around in the image to figure out what is causing the failure.\n\n> > Clean up after the first use of apt-get update to, hopefully, cut down layer size.\n> \n> this has no effect\n\nYou're right. I hoped it would help the layer size. It didn't end up mattering.\n",
