    "body": "I did some investigating and have a good idea of what's going on. Here are some facts about Grammarly's functionality:\r\n\r\n* It automatically targets `<textarea>` tags on a website.\r\n* It provides specialized support for popular web apps such as Google Docs.\r\n* It ignores any text contained in `<pre>` tags and several other tags. `<pre>` stands for preformatted text and is a popular method for displaying code on a website. Below is the relevant line in Grammarly's source code:\r\n`l.ignoredTags = new Set([\"PRE\", \"CODE\", \"BLOCKQUOTE\", \"STYLE\", \"SCRIPT\", \"NOSCRIPT\", \"IMG\", \"SVG\", \"CANVAS\", \"AUDIO\", \"VIDEO\", \"IFRAME\", \"EMBED\", \"OBJECT\", \"BUTTON\"])`\r\n\r\nAs a result:\r\n\r\n* The comment box on this issues page is a `<textarea>` tag. Therefore Grammarly works here.\r\n* Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks are wrapped in `<pre>` tags while being edited, and there's no `<textarea>`. Therefore Grammarly does not work there.\r\n* The behaviour is interesting while editing Markdowns on GitHub, such as a README. The editor is wrapped in a `<textarea>`, so the Grammarly button appears. However, all the code are wrapped in `<pre>` tags, so it sees no text to analyze and the button isn't clickable.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think the only way we can resolve this issue is to ask Grammarly to specifically support Jupyter.",
