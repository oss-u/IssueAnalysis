    "body": "I am fine trying this out. I think the main take home I have from this redesign is that it is going to be really difficult to satisfy every usage case with a single table style. This design, while being used by Pandas, it designed to be completely generic and general. This particular change may be fine to use in general, but I think if Pandas wants to do custom things, they should push HTML with inline styles that modify needed things. This is especially true with all the complexities of nested indices.",
