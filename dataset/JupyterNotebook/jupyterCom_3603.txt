    "body": "I have an answer seen in the [SO post 47522316](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47522316/exit-pdb-interactive-mode-from-jupyter-notebook), listed above. The answer given is not necessarily satisfactory, but works for me:\r\n\r\nThe only way I have been success is to copy/paste the Crtl-D character from another source. I use Emacs, so this is fairly easy, but any text editor that allows you to insert a Crtl-D into the document should work. Once inserted, use the standard copy/paste into the pdb interact field and hit RETURN or ENTER . This should get you out.\r\n\r\nFor Emacs, the long way is as follows, for demonstration purposes:\r\n```\r\nM-x insert char <RET> END OF TRANSMISSION <RET>\r\n```\r\nAt this point you should see ^D in the buffer. At this point select the character and M-w or kill-ring-save to put it on the clipboard.\r\n\r\nThen, change to the browser and make the interactive field active, and paste the character back. You will not see anything. Then hit RETURN or ENTER . This should/might get you out.",
