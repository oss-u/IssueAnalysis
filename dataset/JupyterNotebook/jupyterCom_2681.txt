We're seeing this in ipywidgets, where we explicitly set that to `false`, but now the prompt area is still shown.\r\n\r\nFor now, we'll just hardcode some css to hide the prompt area in output widgets. I think it would be enough to check `this.prompt_area` and if it is false, explicitly hide the prompt area as before.\r\n\r\nCC https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/1765",
