But for API functions like `install_nbextension()`, I think it's better for them to use the logging machinery unless writing output to the terminal is explicitly what the function is for - which it's not in this case.\n\nI'm not sure why it matters that stuff is written to stderr instead of stdout, though? I think of stderr as a side-channel to display info to the user when the main output channel is redirected; it doesn't necessarily indicate that something has gone wrong.\n",
