    "body": "I figured that I should just submit a PR to start this process: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3097\r\n\r\nI think that covers all uses of `require` in this repo. As for providing a _simple_ way for extensions authors/maintainers to do the same, here's a sampling of `require` usage across many extensions: https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=require&type=\r\n\r\nThe patterns looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndefine([ 'require' ], function(require) {\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some (including the cookiecutters), there is also:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * Configure requirejs.\r\n */\r\nif (window.require) {\r\n  window.require.config({\r\n    map: {\r\n      '*': {\r\n        'jupyterlab_json': 'nbextensions/jupyterlab_json/index'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo replacing `require` with `requirejs` in those contexts should cover most cases. If we want to provide a comprehensive solution, we can use [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) which uses and AST-based approach. Here's an example of a codemod that replaces `require` statements with `import` statements: https://github.com/cpojer/js-codemod/blob/master/transforms/rm-requires.js",
