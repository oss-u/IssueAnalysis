Any updates here?\n\nI assume there would be some list of type identifier strings that each token could provide.\n\nIf so, and they were stable across machines and versions, and we had indexing (long-missed feature), and a tree of notebooks could be opted in (jupyter nblibrary index)...\n\na documentation author would be able to reference the symbol type strings in cell metadata (new ui), to allow contextual \"open documentation for...\" with examples, etc. (New ui) This annotation could be done automatically, probably, though it could be guided so that not everyone documents \"import\".\n\nThis would put us almost at parity with the Mathematica documentation machinery...
