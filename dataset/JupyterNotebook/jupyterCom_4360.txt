There is a reasonable amount of info  and input from devs in that issue, and pointing towards codemirror as the culprit.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the f-string literal hasn't been properly fixed; the syntax highlight has been slightly improved so it only breaks on that line of code rather than the rest of the notebook and the indentation problem hasn't been addressed at all.\r\n\r\nPS. we also have issue 445 in jupyter [here](https://github.com/jupyter/help/issues/445): ",
