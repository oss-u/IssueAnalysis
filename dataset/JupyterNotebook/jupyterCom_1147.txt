    "body": "Hello @stonebig thank you for your reply. I see now that I don't explain whole actions I done to repair this problem.\n\nFirst I explain my system configuration. I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit operating system with Service Pack 1, for python I used WinPython 3.4.3.6 64 bit with Qt5 for quite some time with is laying on C drive only extra library I use is nptdms, pyDOE installed via pip installer.\n\nSecond I mechanical engineer on technical university typically use python for data processing of lab result. For example we record cutting force in girding process using National Instruments solutions an in result I get TDMS file with data. And using python I run fast furrier transformation, data filtering, linearisation of signal and other different things for signal processing.\n\nI also use python for creating mathematical models using regression based on recorded data. And to prepare research plans using pyDOE. I also use python for some other thing won't worth mention, like RaspberryPi programming etc.\n\nProblem occurred when I try to read data from oscilloscope. I have 10M csv file with I try to read using `numpy.genfromtxt(\"DS0001.csv\")` but I forget to use `rowskip=16` so I stop using button showed on picture below. And next i restart kernel.\n![2016-02-26_11h59_23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17483620/13351524/6fb160a6-dc87-11e5-8b7d-26a9c79e4b7b.png)\n\nAnd after this I experience problem showed in original post.\n\nNow I describe what I done to solve a problem.\n1. I of course restart PC. And try run it again, but without success.\n2. I download new version of WinPython 3.5.1.2 64bit and unpack it to `C:\\Users\\mark\\WinPython 3.5.1.2' and try to run Spyder form this instance with empty IPython window. so I run`jupyter qtconsole --debug` with result similar like in original post but different network ports.\n3. I suspect that maybe is something wrong with Qt but demo programs are working.\n4. I try if network ports are open using `netstat -a` ports are in LISTENING state and ESTABLISHED. To check if everything is OK I try to disable Kaspersky firewall, but it does not help.\n5. I suspect then in some configuration files there is some problem. So I create separate system user with admin rights  and unpack WinPython in download folder and run here also without result.\n6. So I go back to original user account and try to run different version with i used before I unpack WinPython 3.3.5.0 64bit and try to run spyder with some IPython output but also with no prompt. Like showed on picture below.\n   ![2016-02-26_12h25_03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17483620/13351533/8831d2be-dc87-11e5-85da-253ef4e8e38a.png)\n7. I copy WinPython 3.5.1.2 to `C:\\Programs\\` where I typically store Python instance, and using windows command line I try to reinstall jupyter with command `pip uninstall jupyter` and `pip install jupyter` but after this I still don't have prompt.\n8. When I started learning python few years back I started with python(x,y) package, but it don't had 64bit and python 3 so I switch to WinPython. So i think to try other python pack. Yesterday I find an install try to install `Anaconda3-2.5.0-Windows-x86_64` but in this instance of python also when I run `jupyter qtconsole` don't get prompt.\n9. I start to wonder maybe some libraries are broken so i try update `Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) SP1` but also with no result.\n\nSo I wrote original post with asking for help.\n\nIn respond to @stonebig i put `pip list` result.\n\n> C:\\Programs\\WinPython\\python-3.5.1.amd64>pip list\n> adodbapi (2.6.0.7)\n> alabaster (0.7.7)\n> astroid (1.4.4)\n> astroML (0.3)\n> Babel (2.2.0)\n> backports-abc (0.4)\n> baresql (0.7.3)\n> bcolz (0.12.1)\n> beautifulsoup4 (4.4.1)\n> blaze (0.9.1)\n> blosc (1.2.8)\n> bloscpack (0.9.0)\n> bokeh (0.11.1)\n> Bottleneck (1.0.0)\n> bqplot (0.5.1)\n> brewer2mpl (1.4.1)\n> castra (0.1.6)\n> certifi (2015.11.20.1)\n> cffi (1.5.0)\n> click (6.2)\n> cloudpickle (0.1.1)\n> colorama (0.3.5)\n> cvxopt (1.1.7)\n> cx-Freeze (4.3.4)\n> cycler (0.9.0)\n> cyordereddict (0.2.2)\n> Cython (0.23.4)\n> cytoolz (0.7.4)\n> dask (0.7.6)\n> datashape (0.5.1)\n> db.py (0.4.4)\n> decorator (4.0.6)\n> dill (0.2.4)\n> docopt (0.6.2)\n> docutils (0.12)\n> emcee (2.1.0)\n> Flask (0.10.1)\n> Flask-Cors (2.1.2)\n> formlayout (1.1.0)\n> geopy (1.11.0)\n> greenlet (0.4.9)\n> guidata (1.7.5)\n> guiqwt (3.0.2)\n> h5py (2.5.0)\n> holoviews (1.4.1)\n> html5lib (0.9999999)\n> husl (4.0.3)\n> idlex (1.13)\n> ipykernel (4.2.2)\n> ipyparallel (5.0.0)\n> ipython (4.1.1)\n> ipython-genutils (0.1.0)\n> ipython-sql (0.3.7.1)\n> ipywidgets (4.1.1)\n> itsdangerous (0.24)\n> jedi (0.9.0)\n> Jinja2 (2.8)\n> joblib (0.9.4)\n> jsonschema (2.5.1)\n> julia (0.1.1.8)\n> jupyter (1.0.0)\n> jupyter-client (4.1.1)\n> jupyter-console (4.1.0)\n> jupyter-core (4.0.6)\n> Keras (0.3.1)\n> lazy-object-proxy (1.2.1)\n> llvmlite (0.8.0)\n> lmfit (0.9.2)\n> locket (0.2.0)\n> lxml (3.5.0)\n> Markdown (2.6.5)\n> MarkupSafe (0.23)\n> matplotlib (1.5.1)\n> mistune (0.7.1)\n> mpld3 (0.2)\n> multipledispatch (0.4.8)\n> mysql-connector-python (2.0.4)\n> nbconvert (4.1.0)\n> nbformat (4.0.1)\n> netCDF4 (1.2.2)\n> networkx (1.10)\n> nltk (3.0.5)\n> nose (1.3.7)\n> notebook (4.1.0)\n> numba (0.23.1)\n> numexpr (2.4.6)\n> numpy (1.10.4)\n> numpydoc (0.5)\n> oct2py (3.4.0)\n> odo (0.4.1)\n> pandas (0.17.1)\n> pandas-datareader (0.2.0)\n> param (1.3.2)\n> partd (0.3.2)\n> path.py (8.1.2)\n> patsy (0.4.1)\n> pep8 (1.7.0)\n> pg8000 (1.10.2)\n> pickleshare (0.6)\n> Pillow (3.1.1)\n> pip (8.0.2)\n> pkginfo (1.2.1)\n> prettytable (0.7.2)\n> prompt-toolkit (0.57)\n> psutil (3.4.2)\n> ptpython (0.28)\n> PuLP (1.6.1)\n> py (1.4.31)\n> PyAudio (0.2.9)\n> pybars3 (0.9.1)\n> pycparser (2.14)\n> pyflakes (0.9.2)\n> Pygments (2.1)\n> pylint (1.5.4)\n> pymc (2.3.6)\n> PyMeta3 (0.5.1)\n> pymongo (3.2)\n> pyodbc (3.0.10)\n> PyOpenGL (3.1.1b1)\n> pyparsing (2.0.7)\n> PyQt4 (4.11.4)\n> PyQtdesignerplugins (1.1)\n> pyqtgraph (0.9.10)\n> PyQwt (5.2.1)\n> pyreadline (2.1)\n> pyserial (3.0.1)\n> pystache (0.5.4)\n> pytest (2.8.5)\n> python-dateutil (2.4.2)\n> python-hdf4 (0.9)\n> PythonQwt (0.5.5)\n> pytz (2015.7)\n> pywin32 (220)\n> PyYAML (3.11)\n> pyzmq (15.2.0)\n> QtAwesome (0.2.0)\n> qtconsole (4.1.1)\n> QtPy (0.1.3)\n> redis (2.10.5)\n> reportlab (3.2.0)\n> requests (2.9.1)\n> requests-toolbelt (0.5.1)\n> rope-py3k (0.9.4.post1)\n> rpy2 (2.7.8)\n> Rx (1.2.4)\n> scikit-image (0.11.3)\n> scikit-learn (0.17)\n> scilab2py (0.6)\n> scipy (0.17.0)\n> seaborn (0.7.0)\n> setuptools (19.6.2)\n> simplegeneric (0.8.1)\n> simplejson (3.8.1)\n> six (1.10.0)\n> snowballstemmer (1.2.1)\n> Sphinx (1.3.5)\n> sphinx-rtd-theme (0.1.9)\n> spyder (3.0.0.dev0)\n> SQLAlchemy (1.0.11)\n> sqlite-bro (0.8.10)\n> sqlparse (0.1.18)\n> statsmodels (0.6.1)\n> sympy (0.7.6.1)\n> tables (3.2.2)\n> Theano (0.7.0)\n> toolz (0.7.4)\n> tornado (4.3)\n> traitlets (4.1.0)\n> twine (1.6.5)\n> twitter (1.17.1)\n> ViTables (2.1)\n> wcwidth (0.1.6)\n> Werkzeug (0.11.3)\n> wheel (0.26.0)\n> winpython (1.3)\n> wrapt (1.10.6)\n> xarray (0.7.0)\n> xlrd (0.9.4)\n> XlsxWriter (0.8.4)\n> You are using pip version 8.0.2, however version 8.0.3 is available.\n> You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.\n\nThere is no npTDMS and pyDOE because it's clean install.\n",
