If I get the green light with this, I'll add a require.js bit for backwards compatibility, because as-is require-ing single modules leads to errors, because this PR changes the modules from AMD to commonjs.  Adding commonjs support to requirejs isn't bad at all, we can either use write a custom plugin that does it automagically, or use a premade one -> https://github.com/guybedford/cjs .  The premade one breaks backwards compatibility, requiring people to use the following syntax in their requirejs paths `cjs!path/to/file`.\n",
