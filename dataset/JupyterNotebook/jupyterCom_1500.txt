Or it may be simpler to display all the Javascript rather than putting it into an nbextension.\n",

I hope now all in one. opentype needs a subdirectory called fonts, with the Roboto font in it. I've added them al togther. I am trying to use plain JS as much as possible, and JS only as much as possible; but I think these two arein factory structure, somehow notebook does not recongize them. \n[tryText.zip](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/files/291699/tryText.zip)\n",
