    "body": "> @Carreau is the shortcut editor released yet?\n\nNo it's only on master for now, and it would still need a custom extension to add such an action. \n\nNote that the `\\alpha<tab>` is taken care of by **IPython** note the notebook, as it is an actual kernel completions that will work only on CodeCell. If it would be useful I think developing an extension should not be too hard, but it will likely need to extend codemirror. \n\nI would strongly recommend a custom keyboard layout use something like [ukelele](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14495/ukelele)  on mac, you can set up a dead-key/compose key to type any unicode caracters or abbreviation. it has the advantage of working in all applications. \n",
