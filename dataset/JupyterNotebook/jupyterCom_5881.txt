I don't see it defined in `jupyter lab --help-all` yet it behaves as if it's `--app-dir`.\r\n\r\nSince this option appears to be managed via jupyter lab's configuration (it shows as an unrecognized option running `jupyter notebook --app=%s`), this issue should _start_ in the jupyterlab repo.  Also, if changes are warranted in the hosting server application, I suspect this change would only be entertained in Jupyter Lab 3+, which uses Jupyter Server as its server, rather than notebook.\r\n\r\n@jasongrout - I don't have transfer rights to jupyterlab (and this may even belong in jupyterlab-server, I don't know).  Would you mind transferring this issue to the appropriate location? ",

Note that the `--app=%s` is part of the `browser` parameter.\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter notebook --browser=\"{path to chrome} --app=%s\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also works, but is far less useful since it opens a new window when you open each notebook.\r\n\r\nIf Jupyter lab 3 is going to bypass notebook entirely, then maybe it is better discussed there, since, as I said, it's not very useful for the notebook UI.",
