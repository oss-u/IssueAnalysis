    "body": "Thanks @mwouts.  I'm not familiar with the front-end and what kind of preprocessing it might do when opening a notebook, but I do have a couple of questions - mostly out of curiosity.\r\n\r\n> in the background the notebook is partially loaded (it is truncated, in fact)\r\n\r\nHow did you determine this?  Is this via the browser's dev tooling?\r\n\r\nHave you tried using the jupyter lab front end to see if the issue occurs there?  If so, there's a much higher likelihood of someone looking into this.\r\n\r\nAnd, just to clarify, this isn't happening when _executing_ that particular cell, but rather when the notebook is initially _opened_ (and the kernel started) prior to cell execution - correct?\r\n\r\nAny idea on how latent the connection is relative to the two cases (failing and working)?\r\n\r\n\"internalError: too much recursion\" appears to be closely tied to javascript, which is consistent with why you wouldn't see messages logged in the server.  I think the \"lab test\" would be a good data point if that's possible (thanks).\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @kevin-bates :wave: \r\nThanks for your suggestions! Again maybe there's no real need to troubleshot this (especially there is no such issue with JLab). Below are a few answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n> in the background the notebook is partially loaded\r\n\r\nWell on the screenshot, you see a notebook behind the message... that is my notebook! By partially loaded I mean that in fact it is truncated, the end of the notebook is missing.\r\n\r\n> Have you tried using the jupyter lab front end to see if the issue occurs there?\r\n\r\nI just tried, and good news - no issue there, the notebook is loaded in full.\r\n\r\n> this isn't happening when executing that particular cell, but rather when the notebook is initially opened\r\n\r\nThat is correct. The issue occurs when the notebook is initially opened.\r\n\r\n> Any idea on how latent the connection is relative to the two cases\r\n\r\nOnly a very basic idea... with the fast connection the notebook is loaded in 6 seconds in Jupyter Lab, with the slower one it takes 14 seconds.",
