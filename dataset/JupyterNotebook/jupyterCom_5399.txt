You should probably do that first, then clone your fork, instead of notebook.  This will allow you to work relative to your fork.\r\n\r\nI always update my master branch from 'upstream' (which is the remote reference to notebook), then create my working branch off my updated master.  I usually choose a branch name indicative of what I'll be working on.  Some prefer to have their working branch reference the issue number as well, but I feel like that just takes up characters - since your pull request will reference the issue anyway.\r\n\r\nFor this particular issue, a branch name like `fix-textfile-logout` would be fine - but its up to you.\r\n\r\nOnce your branch is updated and the commit(s) are in place, you then push your branch to your fork (typically referred to as `origin`, although the notebook repo is probably referenced as `origin` right now - so you might look at the options to `git remote` to rename your current `origin` to `upstream`,  it might be good to do that before cloning your branch.)

I have already pushed the code, but next time I will adopt the workflow you recommended (branch, etc). \r\n\r\nI see the option to create a pull request, but I am unsure of what branch to select. master, 4.x, 4.0.x, etc. I would assume 4.0.x since the x would hold bug fixes (Semantic Versioning)? Not sure. ",
