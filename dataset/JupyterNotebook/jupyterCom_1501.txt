    "body": "Hi, @minrk . Sorry for replying you so late. Before I change the structure of the code, I want to know your idea about the big file upload function. \nI add an additional upload button, and the only function is to upload files, not related with saving files. Current design is a little different to the default upload button. \nWhen you choose a set of files and click \"open\", these files will start uploading immediately, there is no \"start\" button (though it can be added). \nMoreover, when an upload is done, the item bar will not destroy. Instead, I added a \"Hide\" button for user.\n1. Do you think if I need to follow the default upload's logic?\n2. Should I just leave one button for upload?\n![updemo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14834924/15753407/e77d854e-28c0-11e6-9c1f-dca2827e26ec.png)\n",
