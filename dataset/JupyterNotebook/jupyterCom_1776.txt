According to our _release policy_, UI changes are reserved for major releases. However, I am comfortable releasing this with 4.3 as it changes a non-interactive UI (vs. something interactive, like the menu or toolbar). Given the Windows blog post, we should save the shiny new table for a rainy day 😋.\n\nRegarding `:hover`, here's a quick stab at it using a lighter shade of the _selected cell indicator_ color:\n\n![screenshot](http://g.recordit.co/sfEjVXTG6P.gif)\n\nI think it's a nice feature to have whether the table is very wide or not.\n\n@ellisonbg What are your thoughts about the hover and backporting given @Carreau's thoughts?\n",

    "body": "> My only concern about waiting for 5.0 is that release may take a while to get out [...] in the past we have planned on doing that [5.0] at the same time as JupyterLab 1.0\n\nAnd that's exactly the reason I **don't** want to backport. There have been a number of things we said we wouldn't do (like make JupyterLab only an extension) exactly to push notebook 5.0 _forward_. \nI also saw that the `notebook_server` was forked from `notebook` which IMHO is too early, and one more reason to neglect the current notebook.\n\nBackporting starts to become hard, and I'm in favor of saying that if you want things out, then some cycles of the developers of JupyterLab should be spent on making 5.0 a reality. I don't have much time to help @gnestor and I don't want to bother him more. PLus with 4.x growing and 5.0 on it's way + JupyterLab, the testing of each branch by developer is quasi-null. Which increase the risk of bugs.\n\nAlso, for example 4.x does _not_ have the ability to order file by date in the dashboard which is well beyond time to release. So while I can't prevent you from backporting things to 4.x, I'm exceptionally going to start putting the strongest -1 on backporting to 4.x until 5.0 is out, starting with this. \n\n> In terms of a hover, I am open to it.
