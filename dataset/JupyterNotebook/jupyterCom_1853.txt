    "body": "Hi there, \n\nThanks for the suggestion, pep 8 also says:\n\n> A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds\n> One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, \"Readability counts\".\n\nSo pep8 is mostly a guideline, and is often recommended to be applied in spirit, see for example [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) from Raymond Hettinger one of core Python developer. \n\nAlso the notebook is not only for Python so we can't (and won't) enforce python-only rules. \nSome extensions allow you to show a ruler to help you organize your code. \n\nWe can try to keep that as a suggestion though and might refine the snapping on future revisions.\n\nThanks. \n",
