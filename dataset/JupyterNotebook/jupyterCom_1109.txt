    "body": "The emacs key bindings are not that hard, the issue is with Vim that already have a dual command/edit mode. \n\nWe (@parleur and I) think it should be possible to \"never\" be in jupyter command mode, and have extra keybindings for codemirror that trigger actions at notebook level. \n\nSo  you can do things like `<esc>:run all`, or `:<esc>:above` , or alike. \nIt needs some refactor, like replacing \n\n``` javascript\nif (this.mode === 'edit') {\n    return this.edit_shortcuts.call_handler(event);\n} else if (this.mode === 'command') {\n  return this.command_shortcuts.call_handler(event);\n}\n```\n\nby something like:\n\n``` javascript\nnew_mode = this.mode[this.current_mode].call_handler(event)\nthis.current_mode = new_mode\n```\n\nTo gain some flexibility, and some patching of markdown cell to switch the rendering on focus.\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\nThis PR is more difficult than I thought, so I wanted some time to pursue in my side (means testing many things an discards it). I reopen it because I need Travis working, and I because I am not lost anymore. Yet it is still far from a serious working PR.\n\n### What are the goal?\n- enable vim-mode without crasy three mode to manage ( @jdfreder I tried vimception )\n- be able to dynamically switch edition mode\n- make the previous stuff convenient ( and it's far to be a detail ...)\n\n### What works\n- mostly trap the user in notebook edition mode (except when doing things with mouse) so that working with the notebook could be done in keyboard only when proper shortcut for every notebook functionality will be finished\n- Switch and switch back between vim mode and default mode without too much bug.\n\n### Tricky corners\n- @Carreau and I 've discussed about \"never be in notebook command mode\", that what is implemented but nearly never... the 'vim-command' state is just transitionnal for all keyboard event, but we may enter in when doing mouse things. That's the way we found not to be too aggressive with the existing code.\n- each edition mode should have two Shortcuts object  (like 'vim-command' and 'vim-edit'). When keyboard manager 's function 'edit_mode' or 'command_mode', the keyboard stay in 'vim' mode or in 'default' mode depending ... Not so cleanly implemented now\n\n### Minimum work to make this usable ( a lot !!! )\n-  [x] new cell should be configured in correct edition mode\n-  [x] ~~up/down keyboard aren't handled properly~~ -> issue with codemirror: edit mode and command mode doesn't react the same way with setCursor (patched in codemirror see bellow)\n-  [ ] ex command in vim mode should access notebook feature -> in different PR\n-  [ ] visual interface for ex command is very poor and should be corrected -> in different PR\n-  [ ] make tests ( and it is not a detail either)\n-  [ ] make the quickhelp relational with the current keymap -> in different PR\n\n### About other keybindings\n\n@hack-c I am not not very attached to other keybinding than vim mode, mostly because I am not able to imagine what an emacs/sublime user would like. Neithertheless, I presume than making a convenient keymap for emacs or sublime would turn around redefine what CodeMirror should handle and what Jupyter should and dynamic CM config. These are problems I have. Now that I am less lost, I 'll be more reactive if you re still want to help.\n",
