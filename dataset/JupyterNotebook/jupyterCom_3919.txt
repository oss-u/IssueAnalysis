    "body": "> There is an effort to keep feature parity with the jupyterlab, which stops the Jupyter notebook from switching from marked to a different markdown renderer.\r\n\r\nHere's a partial answer in the time I have right now. It's the other way around: JLab is keeping parity with the notebook, which prevents JupyterLab from switching to a different markdown renderer (if the notebook switched, lab would most likely do the same). But the bigger issue is that in reality, both the notebook and lab are keeping parity with the user expectations for millions of existing notebooks, which makes it hard for either to switch.",
