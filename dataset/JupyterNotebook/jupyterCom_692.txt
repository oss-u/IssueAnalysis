When I did the initial action re-naming, I knew\nthat these actions in particular were going to need some additional work\nthat would probably be informed by the new model design we were doing.\n\n@jasongrout and I had a conversation yesterday discussing if \"collapsed\" or\n\"visible\" is the right word to use here and in the new models. Because the\nUI will need to display _some_ visible representation indicating that an\noutput or input is present by not fully seen, I don't think the word\n\"visible\" quite captures it - it is visible, just not in its full\nrealization - in other words, it is \"collapsed\".
