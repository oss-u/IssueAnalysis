    "body": "@Nodeswitch - your configuration setting looks correct (`c.MappingKernelManager.default_kernel_name='newDefault'` should also work).\r\n\r\nTo confirm the default is in place, hit the kernelspecs REST API of your running notebook server (e.g., http://localhost:8888/api/kernelspecs) and you should see the default kernel name as the first entry in the returned payload.  For example, I have temporarily set my default to `ir`:  \r\n```\r\n{\"default\": \"ir\", \"kernelspecs\": {\"python3\": {\"name\": \"python3\", ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, as Thomas points out, the default kernel name is rarely used.  It really only comes into play when a request is received to start a kernel and the kernel name is not specified in the request payload.  Since both Notebook and Lab UIs essentially require the user to select a kernel (for new notebooks), it doesn't really come into play.",
