This approach changes the server-info structure (which I'm not sure will have side-affects) and introduces another package.  Given you've found closing the handle resolves the known issue, let's stick with that for now. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI'm going ahead with this closure.  Should we find something more than closing the handle we can reopen at that time.",
