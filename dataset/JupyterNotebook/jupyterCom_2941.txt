    "body": "Unless specified otherwise in config or environment variables, the notebook server will use the current working directory *at start time* as the notebook directory. As I've noted over on SO, yours seems to be set to the documents folder becuase the Anaconda shortcut is doing a little magic to set the working directory to there before starting the notebook server. For you purposes, you could: \r\n\r\n1. Explicitly set the notebook directory in a config file or environment variable\r\n2. Assume the notebook root is at \r\n   ```python\r\n   os.path.expanduser('~/Documents')\r\n   ```\r\n   (note this may not work if OS language is not English)\r\n3. Use the pip/conda package `menuinst` to replicate the same logic exactly:\r\n    ```python\r\n    from menuinst.windows.knownfolders import FOLDERID, get_folder_path\r\n    documents_folder, exception = get_folder_path(FOLDERID.Documents)\r\n    if exception:\r\n        documents_folder, exception = get_folder_path(FOLDERID.PublicDocuments)\r\n    if exception:\r\n        print('bang! exception!')\r\n    else:\r\n        print(documents_folder)\r\n    ```",
