I have my jupyter lab running in the tmux session, the cell takes ~ 30-60 min (loading a file, or stuff like that); I close my laptop, go home; open my laptop, reconnect to the jupyter lab and see this websocket time out or it happens when I away from my computer when the computation is happening and but if my laptop goes to sleep, the websocket error kills the notebook.
