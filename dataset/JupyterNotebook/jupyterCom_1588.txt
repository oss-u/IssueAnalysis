We have some code somewhere that makes it possible to import a notebook, but the notebook environment is not great for writing the sort of code that you import.\n\nCode often starts in interactive notebooks and later moves to modules, and we know that that refactoring process is not very smooth at the moment. We're interested in ways to make that more pleasant.\n",
