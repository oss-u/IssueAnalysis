On the surface, everything looks good, but I'd prefer another set of eyes on this particular review.\r\n> \r\n> One reservation I have is that these translations were performed via the [Translator Text API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/). In my experiences with i18n on other projects, this task was typically performed by humans, often with multiple iterations, due to contextual misunderstandings, etc. Assuming you speak/read Dutch, how well do you feel the translations are in preserving the original intent of the given message? It would be good to minimize the number of fixups required because the machine didn't quite interpret intent correctly.\r\n\r\n@kevin-bates I checked the translations and changed them where I found necessary, but you are absolutely right and probably iterations are necessary. I changed the commit to a [WIP] and gave some instructions above, I also noticed that the `.pot` and `.po` files were out of sync and raised [issue #5356](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5356).",
