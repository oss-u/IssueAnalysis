That triggers ultimately an `npm run build`, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nDo you know if that's smart enough to track dependencies and only build what's needed, or is it stupid and does it do a full rebuild?

Since our js build takes so long now, I find that I don't use the hooks any more, and only build manually because I often check out branches just to look at them, not necessarily run them.\n",

Here are some thoughts: \r\n\r\n* Pull the latest from master: `git pull jupyter master`\r\n  * With git-hooks installed, this will build this JS, CSS, etc. However, git-hooks needs to be installed by the user, so we shouldn't assume that the user has them installed.\r\n* If git-hooks are not installed, rebuild the JS and CSS: `npm run build`\r\n* If actively developing: `npm run build:watch` which just re-runs `npm run build` whenever the source is modified\r\n  * @fperez I've noticed that our bower script is smart enough to only install dependencies that have changed, and since we have removed webpack, we don't really depend on anything but bower dependencies. So, build time for me is about 3s now (vs. ~12s with webpack).\r\n  * @fperez `npm run build` === `python setup.py js css`\r\n* When switching between major version branches (e.g. 4.x), I believe that `pip install -e .` is required, correct?\r\n* If all else fails, `git clean -xfd` and `pip install -e .` should do it",

    "body": "Hi @thachmai! Thanks for offering to contribute! \r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the description:\r\n\r\n>  - A: Check if you have run `npm run build` prior to `jupyter notebook`.\r\n>  - Q: Is there a way to automate entering `npm run build` each time that I run new code updates\r\n\r\nThe answer is: `npm run build:watch`. While you're at it, you can add a script to the package.json for `watch` that just calls `npm run build:watch`. It is common practice to provide a `npm run watch` script these days 👍 \r\n\r\n> - [ ] Revisit the docs on editing the notebook configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what we need here...\r\n\r\n> - [ ] Add a link from the README to a Troubleshooting/Tips page in the docs\r\n\r\nThe troubleshooting docs are located at https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/5711075f0b48dcf4f7ffcd4d93b35ecd1fe363d0/CONTRIBUTING.rst#L76",
