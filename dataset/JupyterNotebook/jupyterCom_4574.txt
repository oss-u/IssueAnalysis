    "body": "This issue is because you're picking up, for whatever reason, a version of jupyter_core older than 4.4.0 since that's when `endure_dir_exists` was added - so you're on the right track.\r\n\r\nI notice from your traceback that the python directories are changing from a global anaconda hierarchy to a local (per-user) hierarchy.   I suspect your older jupyter_core is lurking in that latter hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI would continue down your path, focusing on the second hierarchy and ensuring that jupyter_core >= 4.4.0 exists in all envs. \r\n\r\nOne thing I see on the [conda jupyter_core site](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyter_core) is that the win-64 version appears to be `v4.3.0` - so you might force installation of the `noarch` package.  (I'm sorry, but I'm relatively new to python and am not sure how to force that kind of installation.)",
