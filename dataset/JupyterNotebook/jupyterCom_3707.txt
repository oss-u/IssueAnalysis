    "body": "Hi there, thanks for your Pull Request. \r\n\r\nInstructions like that are really appreciated and useful,\r\nI'm unsure if this is the right place for that for a few reason. \r\n\r\n1) We can't be in the business of documenting for all cloud provider, and don't want to favorite one, at least not in the main documentation.\r\n2) Especially on the cloud, these instruction should explain how to setup TLS  certificate and authentication correctly.\r\n3) when deploying on cloud you should likely use JupyterHub (even for a single user) as it can take care of Auth. That is extensively cover in https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/, across providers, and with how to setup storage, user authentication... etc. It also deploy things with kubernetes which might be too big, and hence why it might be better suited for a separate guide. See for example [this blog post](http://words.yuvi.in/post/the-littlest-jupyterhub/) for small deployment.\r\n\r\nThoughts ? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
