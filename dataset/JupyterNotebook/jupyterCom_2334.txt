    "body": "@takluyver or @minrk \r\nSorry to rattle on about this, but I can't rationalise this behaviour in the notebook.  Can you shed any light on what might be happening here?\r\n\r\nAs per the [top of this thread](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2334#issue-216507596), I have a very basic post-save hook that adds cell meta-data (a UUID) to each cell, where it should skip over cells that already have a UUID (ie. NOT overwrite these with a new UUID).\r\n\r\nI have a pre-existing sample notebook (screenshot below) that I open up in Jupyterlab.  I add a new cell to the end of the notebook (red rectangle on lower left) ... and this generates the new cell with a new UUID in 'B', while leaving the existing cells (A) intact (ie. A = A1).  This is the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4063815/26770761/608c804a-49b1-11e7-8ed5-fbf52c18818b.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if I now create a new notebook in the jupyterlab environment (it hasn't pre-existed) and incrimentally add a series of cells, checking the ipynb file structure along the way, it ends up regenerating UUIDs for existing cells, so that A=!A1 and B=!B1. This is NOT the expected behviour.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4063815/26770664/80741504-49b0-11e7-80d7-e54ac7b9dea0.png)\r\n\r\nAm I missing something in my 'hook' that requires me to somehow re-initialise the `juptyer_notebook_config.py` file when new files are added to the compute environment.  The fact that the code works for a pre-existing notebook and not for a newly-generated one has me baffled.  Both notebooks are nbformat v4.2, as per the meta-data below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"metadata\": {\r\n  \"eolas\": {\r\n   \"eolasProjectId\": \"12345\",\r\n   \"gitlabProjectId\": 142,\r\n   \"id\": \"99ae4211-d313-463c-9524-cdc695824db7\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"kernelspec\": {\r\n   \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\r\n   \"language\": \"python\",\r\n   \"name\": \"python3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"language_info\": {\r\n   \"codemirror_mode\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"ipython\",\r\n    \"version\": 3\r\n   },\r\n   \"file_extension\": \".py\",\r\n   \"mimetype\": \"text/x-python\",\r\n   \"name\": \"python\",\r\n   \"nbconvert_exporter\": \"python\",\r\n   \"pygments_lexer\": \"ipython3\",\r\n   \"version\": \"3.6.0\"\r\n  }\r\n },\r\n \"nbformat\": 4,\r\n \"nbformat_minor\": 2\r\n}\r\n```",

What I would have expected is that when it tries to auto-save it would see that the file on disk is different and give you the option to choose what is in the front end or merge.  It could be that the post save hook is not modifying the timestamp by enough time.  A way to test this fact would be to add a delay to the post save hook.  \r\n\r\nAnother thing to check is whether it works in the classic notebook.  From reading the autosave [source](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/e1ba0075f6c5d901f67918e41f434b1788d592f8/notebook/static/notebook/js/notebook.js#L2661) I'd expect the same friction between a post save hook on the server and the front end data model.",
