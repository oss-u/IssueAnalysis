    "body": "Oh, I like this idea! \r\n\r\nPerhaps a related issue: I spent about 20 minutes today trying to get a version of my syllabus (a notebook) to print adequately for handout. I have a table with links in the notebook which caused problems:\r\n\r\n* PDF didn't do Markdown nor HTML tables\r\n* Print Preview shows full links (made table too wide)\r\n\r\nI had to download as HTML and remove some \"print\" CSS to keep the links from showing. The actual notebook is here if interested [1].\r\n\r\nA richer version of \"Download as...\" could conceivably have some options to give more possibilities.\r\n\r\n[1] - https://athena.brynmawr.edu/jupyter/hub/dblank/public/CS110%20Intro%20to%20Computing/2017-Spring/Syllabus.ipynb",

    "body": "An API for controlling nbconvert from the notebook would be really welcome, I asked for something similar in #1629. \r\n\r\nIn the [printview extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/printview) I currently I have to call the Python kernel of the notebook directly  to be able to customize nbconvert options. This is not a good solution and only works when a  Python kernel is running.\r\n\r\nFor testing, some time ago I added a put request to the nbconvert handler, so I was able to transfer a JSON block with nbconvert configuration options from the frontend to the notebook server. That allowed kernel-agnostic per-notebook nbconvert options. This is what I would like to see as functionality in the notebook (obviously not implemented as a hack like I have done).\r\n  ",
