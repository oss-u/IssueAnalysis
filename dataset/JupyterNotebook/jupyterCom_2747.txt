We've run before into caching issues which seem resilient to hard-refreshes and manually clearing the cache. I thought we had worked around the worst of them, but perhaps they're biting us again. The things we usually try in this case include:\r\n\r\n- A different browser: you've already tried this, and it did seem to help, which supports my theory.\r\n- A private browsing session: this can bypass the cache\r\n- Running the notebook server on a different port than usual - I think browsers cache per-port.\r\n\r\n@willingc also had the same symptoms which seemed to be related to a browser extension (Lastpass). You're not using the same browser or the same extension, but it could be that a different extension is having a similar effect.",
