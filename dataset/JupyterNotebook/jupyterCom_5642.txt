    "body": "It's tough to determine the context of this question, but I'm assuming you'd like to display an image within a notebook.\r\n\r\nIn looking into this, there are a couple of things to consider.  \r\n1. the path to the image is relative to the running notebook, so unless your notebook directory is '`/`' (root), you'll likely need to adjust the path.\r\n2. There are a few options (again, path may require adjustment):\r\n\r\nFrom a markdown cell, either of the following should work:\r\n`<img src=\"/img/profile.jpg\"/>`\r\nor\r\n`![image](/img/profile.jpg)`\r\n\r\nFrom a python code cell, this should work:\r\n```python\r\nfrom IPython.display import Image \r\n\r\nImage(\"/img/profile.jpg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your kernel is not ipykernel, you'll likely need to consult the kernel's documentation if you want this produced from a code cell.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue since it's not an issue for this repository.",
