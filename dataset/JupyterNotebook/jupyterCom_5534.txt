However, it's tough to determine what might be going on here.\r\n\r\n- Is the 78 MB file the ipynb file itself and you're finding that it takes that long to load?\r\n- Or (more likely), are you trying to read a 78 MB file from within a cell of your notebook?\r\n- Where is the file located relative to your Notebook server?\r\n- What is the code doing that is loading the file?\r\n- What kinds of operations are occurring on that server at this time (might the server be overloaded)?\r\n- What kind of server is it (platform, OS, version)?\r\n\r\nCould you please provide answers to these questions and perhaps it will trigger someone's experiences and they can provide some insight?
