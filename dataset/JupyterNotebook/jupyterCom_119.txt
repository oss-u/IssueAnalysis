    "body": "> Adding a theme menu to the notebook homepage\n\nSee my 2 first blog posts on that : http://carreau.github.io/2013/index.html \nHome page might not be necessary, and configuring the theme might be configuring  a variable in a config file, it's ok for the time being. \n\n> To implement the theme menu we could have it display the contents of the theme folder. Once the user selects a theme we run gulp automatically to regenerate the css. If the user has LiveReloading running in their browser it should automatically update.\n\nGulp is only a developer dependency, so themes can be supposed to be already built. \n\nThe submitting theme to this or another repo is not really first priority, the thing that is missing is **a tool to build a theme given a less file**.\n\nThe problem with https://github.com/nsonnad/base16-ipython-notebook is that [their files](https://github.com/nsonnad/base16-ipython-notebook/blob/master/ipython-3/templates/-dark.css.erb#L48-L50) are by design a copy and past of [ours](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/b536da10d871f87729d3c9a6269a13bf61779213/notebook/static/notebook/less/cell.less#L1-L17). As ours get changed, theirs are out of sync automatically. And frankly you don't build css with a templating engine.\n\nOnce you get the tool to build css-theme **using IPython less files** and the **themes `variable.less`** the rest a is a detail. \n",

Does not infer the theme filename from the `<xxx>.less` file. \nIt should also most likely be updated to get as a parameter the name of the codemirror theme and concatenate its css with the theme.\n\nAlso as I concat the files as a hack the sourcemaps are probably wrong.\nThough that the kind a way of building themes that I thing we should aim for. \n",

    "body": "I feel that this is the easiest way to get people developing themes the right way. In koala you can set it to use an external compiler so we can still use less/lessc (if there's a compatibility issue). For the purposes of building the themes from the developer environment we could just have gulp compile the .less files like it's done now. As long as people are using the original .less files as a reference I see no trouble with making the corresponding themes maintainable. However, the problem with using gulp as the tool to compile .less files from a theme designer stand point is that you need to have the whole iPython build environment. Where as using koala or another self contained option is just a matter of installing it setting it up and using the files that are already present in a default notebook install. \n\nI'm pretty new to gulp but I found this on stack exchange. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30218442/how-to-detect-css-theme-and-work-only-with-this-theme .

I agree that copying the CSS) from Jupyter/IPython and applying these colors is silly. However, we are doing a lot of extra work if we throw out those base16 color schemes; they are very diverse and well done.\n\nThe issue is that with less and most CSS preprocessors there is not a way to dynamically set variables from outside. Hence we need to pass them through a templating engine. Perhaps it would be best to pass only a [`variables.less`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/static/notebook/less/variables.less) through the template, creating one for each theme? Otherwise we will have to modify less so that it is able to have variables overridden from outside, or we need to manually create a bunch of `variables.less` files.\n",
