This is the complaint I hear most often from first time user why is there no way to enter the name of a new folder.I have to search it somewhere in the file viewer and check it and than click on rename that is very different from the workflow most users are used to. They expect to click new folder and enter the name of this new folder right away. As almost all file mangers on Linux/OSx/Windows do it.",
