I mentioned this above, but I'll summarize:\r\n\r\nFor my personal use, this PR was to allow access to hidden files through markdown, not to allow travel to hidden directories/open hidden files in the filebrowser.\r\n\r\nIn order to add that ability you would have to add an option to the filebrowser to view these, you pretty much only have to edit the function `is_hidden` in utils. \r\n\r\nEditing that is relatively easy and straightforward, but i feel like the filebrowser would be super clogged with tons of dotfiles, and could be annoying unless there's a gui option on the filebrowser for showing hidden files, I think it would have to be a toggle specific to TreeHandler, could be wrong, once I start I'll double check.\r\n\r\nDo you think I should go ahead with that instead of my original proposal?",

Configurable, default False.\r\n- For now, setting it to True allows access to hidden files but doesn't show them in the listing (so they're still hidden). We can think about showing them in the list as a separate step after this.\r\n- At @minrk's suggestion, I've removed the command line flag. It's still possible to specify it at the command line by using the full name: `--ContentsManager.allow_hidden=True` .",
