In that case, if the folder is deleted, the explorer takes you to the nearest parent that still exists so that you can get on with your work.\n\nTrying some other stuff, I notice that auto refresh in the webUI picks up when you delete a directory now and gives a message: \"Server error: No such file or directory: subtree/subsubtree\", after I deleted the subdirectory \"subsubtree\". Maybe that's enough.\n\nTesting with a previous version of the notebook didn't even give the 404 error, just a blank page. \n",
