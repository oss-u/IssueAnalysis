In this specific case the old versions contained a wrong CSS file path and now the style sheet won't ever load, because it still uses that old code, where the path is wrong. It is so maddening. I used all of the following to no avail:\r\n\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --sys-prefix\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --sys-prefix\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --system\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --system\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --user\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla --user\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla\r\n    jupyter nbextension uninstall prototype-bla\r\n\r\nBut the notebook still comes up with the extensions in the list of extensions in that tab, which lists them.\r\n\r\nI also tried complete reinstall of my `conda` env. Nope. Still there. Please provide a universal `uninstall` way! Also extensions installed with `--sys-prefix` should always have higher priority than anything loaded from outside a conda env or virtualenv.\r\n\r\n*Edit:*\r\n\r\nI found the remaining installations. It seems there is also a jupyter installation in my base conda environment. In that my extensions were installed as well. The question then is, why would jupyter inside my actual conda env access extensions outside of the environment (in the conda base environment)? It should not do that.",
