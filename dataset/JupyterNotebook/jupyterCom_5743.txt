    "body": "Thanks Matt - I'm not very familiar with conda (and pip for that matter) myself.  In looking into the equivalent of `pip install .` in conda I found there isn't really any other than to be sure to `conda install pip` first, then you can issue `pip install .`.\r\n\r\nSince `pip` is installed by virtue of creating the environment with the specified file, I think the instructions for conda could be listed as follows...\r\n```\r\n     conda env create -f docs/environment.yml\r\n     conda activate notebook_docs  # Linux and OS X\r\n     activate notebook_docs        # Windows\r\n     pip install .\r\n```\r\nAt first, I could not reproduce the issue relative to conda but that was because I had `notebook` installed in my base conda env - which acts as a fallback if my understanding is correct.  Once I removed `notebook` from my base env, then I could reproduce the issue and confirmed that `pip install .` allowed for the docs build to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind adding this to the PR, that would be great.  I'll probably ask for an additional reviewer relative to the conda/pip stuff to be sure no additional notes are necessary or anything like that.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure if -n notebook_docs is necessary if you've already activated the notebook_docs environment\r\n\r\nOnce activated, all actions are performed against the activated env, no need to name it explicitly.",
