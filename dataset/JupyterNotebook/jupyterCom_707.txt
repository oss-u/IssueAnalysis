    "body": "This is inherent to the way the cell-marking is currently implemented. \nThe notion of anchor and cursor in the selection that @takluyver did implement fro multi-selection was removed, while it was one of the only decent way to actually track this kind of selection behavior without a lot of brittle heuristic. \n\nWe might be able to track wether shift-J/K extend or contract the cell marking by looking at wether the cursor is at beginning or end of contiguous marking. Though this become ambiguous in some case where you have non-contiguous marking. \n\nWe cannot either track wether shift was keeped pressed as you can do Shift-J,J,J leave you keyboard then again Shift-J,K,K and should end up with 2 cell selected. \n\nOne of the correct way to implement that is to have the current \"selection\" be composed of a cursor (which is the one you move with J,K, and arrow keys) and an \"Anchor\". The anchor is _in general_ always on the same cell as the cursor, except when you press shift, in which case the _Anchor_, stays on it's current cell. \n\nSee this UI prototype where the anchor is explicitly marked by a Cyan background:\n\nWhen shift is pressed, you can see that the cursor move independantly from the anchor. \n![anchor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/10983609/89d273e8-83c8-11e5-9475-f0220ad2314f.gif)\n\nThe default moving J/K always bring back the **anchor** and the **cursor** together.\n\nI propose we reintroduce the the concept of **multiple selection** where all cells in between the anchor and the cursor are **selected** (and thus implicitly marked), then provide 2 shortcuts: \n- mark all cell in selection \n- unmark all cells in selection\n\nFor which `+` and `-` would be good shortcut candidates. \nThis would make the process of multiple selection/marking much closer to all other  UI exposed to user. Plus this would allow Shift-J/K to deselect marked cells, and will allow most action to be done without an explicit marking. By not needing explicit marking we would also get rid of  lots of issues of having marked cells out of the screen. \n\nThoughts ?\n\nPing @ellisonbg, @jhamrick , @jdfreder \n",
