    "body": "Moving multiple cells up.down is now a simple side-effect of the continuous selection. \nAs then you \"just\" need to move the cell before the selection to just after to \"move the selection up\" and vice versa. \n\nSo unless I'm misunderstanding, I'm going to close this, \n\nThanks a lot though for the time you've put into that, and sorry these commit don't land into master. \n\nWaiting for your next PR !\n\n(closing, feel free to reopen if I missed something) \n",
