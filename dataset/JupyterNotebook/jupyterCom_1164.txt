    "body": "@minrk Looking back at the sources from the traceback, here are some thoughts. Since somewhere along the line when the program gets to write_message, the system has either prematurely closed a websocket or thinks the websocket is closed so an error is thrown.\n\nHere are a couple of PRs that may be related:\n- [747](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/747/files)\n- [898](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/898/files)\n  In this PR, `stream` is set to `None` in `WebSocketMixin` class. When we get further down to where one of the traceback issues was found in [`zmqhandlers` file and `ZMQStreamHandler`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/f19d68a33193dff07e62f11da0ebce331e8acbda/notebook/base/zmqhandlers.py#L212), it's possible that `stream` is still None when `ZMQStreamHandler` is used which may cause the error handler to be called and the traceback emitted. My gut instinct is this is where the problem is, but I don't know the code base well enough to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, this could be context issue where we are not handling the context correctly in eventloop.\n\n```\n# From tornado/stack_context.py\n`StackContext` shifts the burden of restoring that state\nfrom each call site (e.g.  wrapping each `.AsyncHTTPClient` callback\nin ``async_callback``) to the mechanisms that transfer control from\none context to another (e.g. `.AsyncHTTPClient` itself, `.IOLoop`,\nthread pools, etc).\n...\nMost applications shouldn't have to work with `StackContext` directly.\nHere are a few rules of thumb for when it's necessary:\n* If you're writing an asynchronous library that doesn't rely on a\n  stack_context-aware library like `tornado.ioloop` or `tornado.iostream`\n  (for example, if you're writing a thread pool), use\n  `.stack_context.wrap()` before any asynchronous operations to capture the\n  stack context from where the operation was started.\n* If you're writing an asynchronous library that has some shared\n  resources (such as a connection pool), create those shared resources\n  within a ``with stack_context.NullContext():`` block.  This will prevent\n  ``StackContexts`` from leaking from one request to another.\n* If you want to write something like an exception handler that will\n  persist across asynchronous calls, create a new `StackContext` (or\n  `ExceptionStackContext`), and make your asynchronous calls in a ``with``\n  block that references your `StackContext`.\n```\n",
