    "body": "A couple of thoughts:\n\nIn the short/medium term:\n- Getting a full tree based file brower right from the design and\n  interaction standpoint is extremely difficult and time consuming.\n- We are already building a brand new file newer for JupyterLab that has\n  many more features than the current one. The idea is that it would\n  eventually replace the existing dashboard.\n- I don't think we have the capacity to have 3 file browsers in the\n  pipeline at the same time.\n- My own feeling is that tree-based file browsers are more complex for\n  users.\n- But, It would be possible for a third party to build a tree-based file\n  browser as a 4.x nbextension or JupyterLab plugin that is a separate\n  project that users can install and use.\n\nIn the long run:\n- Eventually, after the existing dashboard file browser has gone away, we\n  may have capacity to tackle a more full blown tree view.\n- In some cases, tree-based file browsers work better.\n- A nice balance is the one in Google Drive, which by default is flat (like\n  ours), but still has a tree based view that sits along side of the flat one.\n\nOn Sat, Feb 20, 2016 at 10:23 AM, Bryan Karlovitz notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @takluyver https://github.com/takluyver Sounds good.
