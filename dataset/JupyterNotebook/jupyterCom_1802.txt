There are two types of them: Network and HTTP. (1) Network LB supports websockets but doesn't forward client ip to upstream, (2) HTTP LB forwards client ip to upstream but doesn't support websockets. \n\nWe partitioned our traffic wherein websocket traffic went to a network lb and the rest went to a http lb. ws_url option saved the day for us and allowed us to keep our infrastructure stack fairly simple.\n",
