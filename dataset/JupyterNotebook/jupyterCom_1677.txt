    "body": "> What version of notebook/nbviewer is Github running? How often to they update?\n\nI don't know what version of nbconvert GitHub is using, but they seem to update extremely rarely, if ever, and have not been responsive in particular to longstanding math rendering errors in the version they still have deployed.\n\n> Will this prove problematic for users if these features are enabled in their local environment but not elsewhere like Github?\n\nYes, likely. We can propagate it to nbconvert easily enough, so it can land on nbviewer probably before we release it in the stable version of the live notebook.\n\n> Are ... delimiters for AsciiMath standard?\n\nI'm not sure what's standard in AsciiMath, but what's the impetus for supporting asciimath here? The `$` delimiters we started with for mathjax have proven pretty troublesome, since any delimiter type thing is a defacto extension of markdown, which gets hairy when it starts interacting with the markdown rendering, and further loosens the definition of what markdown we actually support (since it's no longer markdown once there is math).\n",
