IPython shouldn't rely on git being installed, and it would be hard to build a UI around git that is intuitive for novice users. For instance, what if you have changed other notebooks in the repository since deleting the one you now want to recover? Just reverting doesn't help there.\n\nAlso, we're often curating notebooks in repositories manually, and if every save was a new commit to that repository, automated commits with trivial commit messages would quickly take over the history. If you were playing around with plots or other images in notebooks and saving frequently, it would also make the repository balloon in size.\n\nThere are really interesting possibilities with using git as a storage backend for notebooks, and that was one of the cases we had in mind when we made the contents manager & the checkpoint manager APIs that other people can implement. But I don't think it's going to become the default way to run the notebook, and I think we need a solution to this that doesn't rely on it.\n",
