I'll be cruising along all day with no problems, and all of a sudden, my jupyter windows in Firefox will get flaky/slow, and then start refusing to connect at all.  Chrome works fine on those same documents.  Clearing the Firefox cache doesn't fix it.  Restarting the kernel doesn't fix it.  Restarting jupyter server doesn't fix it.  Disabling all firewalls on all machines doesn't fix it.  Disabling all Firefox add-ons doesn't fix it.",
