Please note that just prior to that, I also upgraded `ipykernel`, but when that didn't resolve it, I decided to try the `ipython` upgrade.  Just wanted to share that in case the two steps combined are what is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you could ONLY try the `ipython` upgrade, that would be helpful information.  Hopefully just doing that (or the two steps) will be all you need.",
