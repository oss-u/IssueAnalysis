Thank you for your work here! Unfortunately, this notebook server is going away in favor of [jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/) and we're not really taking new features in this old version of notebook server. If you'd still be interested in seeing this get merged, would you consider moving this PR over there?\r\n\r\nI'm closing this here, but I'd love to see this discussion moved to jupyter_server. Don't hesitate to ping me there. \r\n",
