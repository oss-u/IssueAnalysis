    "body": "Had the same issue today. Solved it conveniently by modifying the MathJax template file `mathjax.tpl` (should be located in `python3.5/site-packages/nbconvert/templates/html/`. Just look for the following snippet:\n\n```\ndisplayAlign: 'center',\n        \"HTML-CSS\": {\n            styles: {'.MathJax_Display': {\"margin\": 0}},\n            linebreaks: { automatic: true }\n        }\n```\n\nand change `{\"margin\": 0}` to `{\"margin-top\": \"10px\", \"margin-bottom\": \"10px\"}`.\n(FYI: `{\"margin\": \"10px\"}` would also increase the margin at the sides (left and right) which can bring you a horizontal scrolling bar in the HTML if your equations are too wide.\n\nI really wonder why `0` is the default here... It looks really ugly and un-LaTeX-ish...\n",
