Some spawners may be able to configure it, but the norm is to make it\navailable in the location that the single user servers expect.\n\nConfiguring MappingKernelManager in Jupyterhub config probably has no\neffect, because Jupyterhub doesn't run that bit of the code. It needs to be\nconfigured from individual notebook servers.\n\nIt depends what you want to do. The MappingKernelManager option shuts down\ninactive kernels.
