Thanks for your pull request. \r\n\r\nIt looks like you may have struggled a bit with git; did you managed to do what you were looking for, or do you need guidance to fix a couple of things ? There seem to be a couple of changes that disappeared in your final version.\r\n\r\nGit can be quite confusing and it may take a couple of month to be fluent with it; we'll be happy to offer advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
