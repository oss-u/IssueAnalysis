If the notebook does not make use of this key then nothing more will be show in the UI than classical completions.\r\n\r\nRecent IPykernel _should_ return better completions, but have not been released yet so it should show up in the notebook once someone has the time to look into releasing Ipykernel.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, when user upgrade they should automatically get better completions.",
