I've got no idea why it worked but I'm sharing so that it might help someone.\r\n\r\nI'm using a Mac with a Hungarian keyboard. I've made some tweaks in the layout so that Option+F is mapped to write `[` and Option+G is mapped to `]`. Later I found that with this settings I cannot type `[` with Option+F into a notebook in Firefox, although (1) typing `[` works outside of a notebook in Firefox, (2) typing `]` works within a notebook in Firefox, and (3) typing both `[` and `]` works in notebooks in other browsers.\r\n\r\nAfter finding this thread I've checked the Firefox config and found that `privacy.resistFingerprinting` is set to `false`. After flipping it to `true` (!) typing `[` in notebooks now works.",
