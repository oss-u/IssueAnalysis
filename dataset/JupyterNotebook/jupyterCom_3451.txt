    "body": "(Sorry about the previous message, looks like Github saved replies are broken just now - I've copied and pasted it below)\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you're trying an import in two different installations of Python, or two different environments. Check `sys.executable` to see which Python and environment you're running in, and `sys.path` to see where it looks to import modules.\r\n\r\nPython packages must be installed separately for each copy of Python you use, and if you are using virtualenvs or conda envs, packages must be installed into each environment where you need them. Either the package is not installed in one, or a different version of the package is installed.\r\n\r\nTo install packages to a particular Python installation or environment using pip, you can run it like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npath/to/python -m pip install ...\r\n# Replace path/to/python with the path of the Python executable (sys.executable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using conda environments, you can install packages from conda like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsource activate myenv  # On Windows, just 'activate myenv' (no 'source')\r\nconda install ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more detail, see [this blog post](http://takluyver.github.io/posts/i-cant-import-it.html).\r\n\r\n[ This is a saved reply because I answer similar questions often - sorry if it doesn't exactly fit your case ]",
