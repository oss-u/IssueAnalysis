I'd like to set it to a minute or so (same with cull interval), but I figured that if I was going to propose changing 300 to 60 or so, then I might as well propose changing the minimum to 1 second.\r\n\r\n> If the cull_idle_timeout minimum is reduced, cull_interval_default and and cull_interval need to be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nHmm... Perhaps I'm misreading the code.  Isn't the default timeout infinity (represented by 0)?  Why would other defaults need to be changed?\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at this.\r\n",

Now that those distinctions exist, I think the _timeout minimum_ can be lifted.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I tend to agree with @parente that an _interval minimum_ is still warranted.  If there are enough active kernels such that checking all for idle timeout exceeds the culling interval, then it seems as though the server could get into a pathological state of only culling (if I'm understanding how tornado works). \r\n\r\nWhat about lifting the timeout minimum, but introduce an interval minimum for the sole purpose of saturation prevention?  Yes, the interval minimum would then act as a logical timeout value.  However, this would also help satisfy the connection issues condition, which could be considered another pathological state example.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm thinking we should impose at least a `10` second interval minimum.",
