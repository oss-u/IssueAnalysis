That’s why I posted the suggestion. \n\nHere’s my workaround though. I do this in Chrome but I’m sure you can figure out something similar in Firefox. \n\nI right click the boarder of the DIV container that holds the cells and I select “Inspect Now”.\n\nSelec the the container div:  “notebook-container”. \n\nIn the Elements tab, on the right side under the Styles tab. \n\nUnder the @Media section you will see “Width:” click that and change it to a percentage. \n\nOn Thu, Dec 08, 2016 at 3:57 PM Sam Zeitlin\n\n<\nmailto:Sam Zeitlin <notifications@github.com>\n> wrote:\n\na, pre, code, a:link, body { word-wrap: break-word !important; }\n\ncan you share the code you use to fix this?

    "body": "I suspect the 1140px width comes from somewhere in the Bootstrap styles, or something else we load from an external source, unfortunately. Our styles are written in a series of `less` files, which are then compiled to CSS, pulling in pieces from third party sources.\r\n\r\nYou can probably set a permanent override in `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css`. You might need a `!important` on it to force it to take precedence over other rules. The `!important` tag is a blunt instrument in CSS terms, so it might mess something else up a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best default is here. For wrappable text, it's generally agreed that you want to limit the maximum width, because it's hard to read very long lines. E.g. Github issues is only taking ~1/3 the width of my screen for this comment, even on a laptop. But I can see that for things like large tables this is frustrating.",

I often use the above workarounds to enable my svg and interactive figures to span the width of my display when working with intricate and detailed plots, e.g. Geo maps or financial tends. If I want the cell width change back to being modestly fixed width, then I just as soon resize my browser window on my desktop, or change my browser zoom factor, or just toggle off the workaround for that time.

Typically a user base will always have a group of people who are averse to change, especially when a UI deviates from the point in time where they learned the application. That's a typical reaction that any product manager or front end developer will be very familiar with. \r\n\r\nThe industry as a whole has settled on full width cells as a standard. This is the outcome of open source and privately funded development that included people who have expertise in UX/UI design. It is important to be consistent with industry standards and benefit from lessons learned by other projects. \r\n\r\nYou can see examples of this in:\r\nJupyter Lab\r\nZeppelin\r\nDatabricks\r\nGoogle Cloud Datalab\r\nHue\r\nData Science Workbench\r\n\r\nThat said, limiting cell width does not enforce coding standards in anyway. A UI is not where this problem is typically solved. That is what a linter is for. If coding standards is a concern there are existing plugins that are better suited to handle that problem and they should be used instead of trying to create a pseudo solution in a UI.  ",
