I'd lean towards something like Kyle's mockup, because it emphasises notebooks, which people get Jupyter for, over text editors & terminals. But maybe there could even be different dashboards configurable for different use cases? Text editors & terminals are valuable if you're logging in to Jupyterhub on a server, but I hardly ever use them when I run the notebook locally.\r\n\r\nAn obvious addition to Kyle's mockup would be for the right-most box to be an 'Install more languages' link leading to the long-awaited kernel directory.\r\n\r\nI thought about a tour, but I'd consider that a fallback if we can't think of anything better. If it starts automatically, it's annoying, and if it doesn't, ~no-one will use it. The notebook tour (which doesn't start automatically, to avoid annoying people) was broken for quite a long time before anyone noticed.",
