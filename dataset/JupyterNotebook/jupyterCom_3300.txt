    "body": "In the IPython kernel, `sys.stdout` is normally a redirection object we've created. Before running each cell, we update it to route the output to the right cell. That's this method:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/75fbaa529ff46da0b4e5cfc5ea6a729f55183594/ipykernel/iostream.py#L303-L304\r\n\r\nBut we only do that if `sys.stdout` is our own OutStream object. So while your redirection is in place, we're not updating our stream object. So if you undo your redirection and write to stdout in the same cell, it's still pointing to the cell where redirection started. Any cells after that should work normally again.\r\n\r\nI guess we could keep another reference to the stdout and stderr objects, so we can update them even when they're not set as `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`.",
