    "body": "A couple of questions for that proposal:\n- What would merge(deep=True) do with a list?\n- How would you recover the current behavior of strictly setting values of container traits? For example, `c.Class.dict_trait = {}`, which currently ensures the trait is an empty dict, overriding less-specific configuration.\n\nWe do have some of this functionality, just not in json config. _Python_ config files do support modifications for container traits, which json config files do not. You can do:\n\n``` python\nc.Class.dict_trait.update({'a': 5})\n```\n\nand it will add values, rather than overriding the whole trait. We could try to define a scheme for expressing such operations in JSON config, though I am wary of defining _operations_ in such a format, rather than values.\n\nRe: nb_conda_kernels, I actually really _don't_ want installing a package like that to be able to change the kernel manager. I really do think installing a package and modifying configuration _should_ be separate steps in the vast majority of cases. What happens when I've installed two custom kernel managers, and they have registered themselves at install time, and assume that `conda install` is everything you need to do? With conf.d-style, I'm guessing the alphabetically last manager would be used. With post-link, it would at least be the most recently installed, probably. Neither one sounds like a good experience.\n",
