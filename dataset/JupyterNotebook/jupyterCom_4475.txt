I am very new to this.\r\n\r\nThank you so much.",

This appears to be a home directory (folder), so try replacing `~` with the appropriate expanded value.  I would remove the drive designator prefix and flip the slashes for starters.\r\n\r\nYou might also get better traction in the repo in which this (possible) solution resides - since those folks would be more up on Spark and ES.",
