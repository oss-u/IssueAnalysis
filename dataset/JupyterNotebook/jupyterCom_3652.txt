And you're right that #3341 is where the sandboxing was introduced. This is a security measure, so we can't just disable it again. If you're interested, I'd suggest someone research what relaxations of the sandbox would be needed to let Chrome display a PDF.\r\n> \r\n> CSP sandboxing docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox\r\n\r\n@takluyver I suppose that as a security measure this is somehow meaningful, but since we already allow the kernel (e.g. python) to do anything to the filesystem, isn't it sort of pointless to have this kind of sandboxing? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \r\n\r\nI do hope this bug can be resolved sooner. Sometimes PDF.js extension feels too clumsy for me... Unfortunately I don't have the necessary expertise to contribute, but I was able to (_kind of?_) circumvent this by reading the PDF as binary from the python kernel, then embedding it with a server side PDF.js engine - which is even clumsier, but at least I don't have to ask every one of my collaborators to install a PDF.js extension. :wink:\r\n\r\n@matanster If you really want PDF in your `ipynb`, you can try something like this. :joy: \r\n\r\n",

People don't expect that opening a document (whether that's a notebook, an HTML page, or a PDF) can start running code outside a sandbox. See also: word macro viruses.\r\n\r\nThe technical implication of this is that any pages served by the notebook server where we don't entirely control the content must either be sandboxed (so they can't talk to kernels) or sanitised (so they can't run Javascript).\r\n\r\nWe sanitise untrusted notebooks, because the notebook page has to be able to talk to the kernel. But sanitisation is tricky, edge cases can be missed (we had a CVE because of an interaction between our sanitisation engine and jQuery), and it breaks a lot of rich content. So we sandbox when serving (non-notebook) files - they can run Javascript, but the browser's cross-origin security mechanisms stop them talking to kernels.",
