    "body": "So I've been working on this recently, and I hope you like the end result.\r\n\r\n30ed681a8f9b75d0a1d9334bcd550904c0b9380f will allow the users to control the direction of the notebook by the following means:\r\n\r\n* a notebook metadata tag, `direction`, which could be either `ltr`or `rtl`\r\n\r\n* a cell metadata tag, again `direction`, that overrides notebook settings. Either `rtl` or `ltr`.\r\n  (Why this one? A common example is that when writing in RTL languages, users often need to write latex equation blocks for which you need an LTR cell. So cell-level control is essential.)\r\n\r\nThe behavior is described below:\r\n\r\n* A notebook without a `direction` tag will be LTR. That is, notebook will ignore browser locale settings from now on. This behavior was suggested by two users in ipython/ipython#10980. It also keeps a notebook from looking different on different computers. However, please note that we're breaking the previous behavior here.\r\n\r\n* A markdown cell without a `direction` tag will inherit direction from notebook. A `direction` tag overrides it. I've also added an action in the command palette \"toggle current cell ltr/rtl layout direction\" which sets the tag for the user. (How about a shortcut for it?)\r\n\r\n* In a code cell, the code itself (code mirror) will never become RTLâ€”no one ever writes code in RTL mode. However, a `direction` tag with value `rtl` will cause the output to become RTL. The code cell always defaults in LTR (that is, it doesn't inherit from notebook settings), because IMHO RTL output from code is rarely required and it would be a pain change it back every time. Most people are just dealing with math or getting simple English logs/errors.",
