    "body": "In what sort of deployment? The KernelManager selects the ports, so you can use a custom KernelManager to select ports in a different way. You would just set the various port attributes on the KM:\n\n``` python\np = 5000\nkm.hb_port = p+1\nkm.shell_port = p+2\nkm.control_port = p+3\nkm.stdin_port = p+4\nkm.iopub_port = p+5\n```\n\nYou cannot generally use a config file to specify kernel ports, since it would mean that all kernels would try to use the same ports and collide. That is, unless you are starting one kernel per IP. You can tell it to use ipc instead of tcp with:\n\n``` python\nc.KernelManager.transport = 'ipc'\n```\n",
