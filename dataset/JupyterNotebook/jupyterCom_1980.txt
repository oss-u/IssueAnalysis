The flaw that prompted adding this mechanism highlighted just how complex browsers and web security are. More special cases makes it harder to be sure we're doing things right.\r\n- Special casing specific origins means more surprising behaviour when you're legitimately accessing it at a different domain.\r\n\r\n> the cookie is not set on both localhost and 127.0.0.1 which is confising.\r\n\r\nI understand that it's confusing, but from the browser's point of view, those are different domains.

    "body": "I've retitled the issue to point to making the info clearer, since we shouldn't disable token auth, or even recommend doing so.\r\n\r\n@mlgill when you launch the notebook server, the token is logged, and you can use this to connect. Or, if the token being generated causes inconvenience, you can use a predetermined value, e.g.\r\n\r\n    jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='super-secret'\r\n\r\n#1972 should have already covered most of this. The login page looks like this now:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"633\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-13 at 13 19 49\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/151929/21315421/64bb29d4-c5fc-11e6-9393-956bea2d8f51.png\">\r\n\r\nwhich better explains why the login page is shown, and shows in detail the exact steps to get the information you need. Logging in with a token is needed once per browser+port+machine combo, so once a user has done this one time on their laptop, they should never need to do it again.\r\n\r\n#1994 should fill in the one remaining gap I see of extra emphasis of the information already in the log output, which will now look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[C 15:17:09.076 NotebookApp]\r\n\r\n    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,\r\n    to login with a token:\r\n        http://localhost:8888/?token=d0b6a3e08ee7d81ce602e8e5f5f3bd4d37f4380f36798df7\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny further feedback on what we should do would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the consternation this has caused. I'd like to get 4.3.1 out very soon with these improvements ASAP.\r\n\r\nAs a side issue, @fperez, I'm not sure how you would have `open_browser = False` if it's not in your `jupyter_notebook_config.py`, but it could happen without any configuration if the webbrowser module cannot find any browser (in which case a `No web browser found:` message is logged).",

    "body": "Thanks @michaelpacer! That was useful, now I know for the future...\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't find any browser-related config flags in any of the paths I got for config:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndenali[~]> jupyter --paths\r\nconfig:\r\n    /Users/fperez/.jupyter\r\n    /Users/fperez/usr/conda/etc/jupyter\r\n    /usr/local/etc/jupyter\r\n    /etc/jupyter\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this rubber-ducking helped me!! Given that there was nothing left, I scoured my environment, and found this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndenali[~]> env | grep -i brow\r\nBROWSER=google-chrome&\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a carryover of my `bashrc` from my Ubuntu days, but on OSX calling `google-chrome` doesn't do anything.  So what was happening in my case was that the browser command was failing, leaving me without a browser.\r\n\r\nThis shows another failure mode that can affect an unsuspecting user: if for whatever reason they don't get the browser to open, they're left to read startup logs (something a new user isn't necessarily always adept at).\r\n\r\nI recently had the opportunity to help a user who was a complete newbie to Python/Jupyter, and it was really satisfactory to be able to get them to go from zero to working notebook with plots in the course of a short session (and it got them excited about the possibilities).  But this person had never interacted with a terminal at all nor had any real experience programming. I'm 100% certain that \"read the log until you find the token URL, then use that to load the session in a browser\" would be simply a bridge too far for them.",

    "body": "@fperez sorry if my response was curt. This is a classic bug that's really annoying for the people it affects, but I still maintain that the vast majority of the new users you're concerned about will not be affected. Obviously we will take any bug you file fairly seriously however it's worded, but I find your bug reports sometimes have a little bit of the \"this must be fixed now\" flavour. And I find that all the more surprising because you have been the one reading and responding to plenty of bug reports in the past, so you know what makes a good one from the maintainers' point of view.\r\n\r\nBack to the issue:\r\n\r\n* To tackle the specific issue that caused your problem, maybe if $BROWSER is set and launching a browser fails, we should assume it's set badly, and try again as if it wasn't set. Scanning through the code of the `webbrowser` module, there doesn't seem to be a good way to do that, but if we think it will affect enough users, I'm sure we can come up with something.\r\n* I totally agree that it's a poor user experience if the server doesn't launch the browser. But I don't see a great way to improve this in general. AIUI, we need to get a secret to the browser. If we can launch the browser, we do that via the command line. If not, we make it available in the terminal and on the filesystem for the user to pick up. We can't transfer it over HTTP (unless I'm missing a trick), because that's the channel we're trying to secure. We can definitely make it clearer what's going on, which we're doing in 4.3.1, but I don't see a way to avoid it.\r\n* If we can't launch the browser and the user isn't looking at a terminal (e.g. because they've launched the notebook from a GUI), we don't have any obvious way to communicate with them even to point out what's going wrong. We could try to find an available GUI toolkit (tkinter is usually there) and open a window with information. This feels very much like a band-aid solution, though.\r\n* We could try to push users into setting a password, so that they know what to enter on the login page. E.g. the Anaconda launcher could get the user to set a password when they first launch the notebook. But this isn't great UX either, and it's extra work for less security (human chosen passwords are easier to guess than a generated token).\r\n* We could provide a GUI [notebook server manager](https://github.com/takluyver/nbmanager) as part of a default install, and add options to launch a browser and to copy the URL from that interface. That gets us back into the local GUI development we've avoided by making a web interface, but maybe that's OK for a tool with much more limited scope.",

    "body": "@takluyver, I do apologize if I have made it sound like \"must be done now\", that's certainly not my intent.  B/c of being overloaded on many fronts, the reality is that lately I tend to file bugs only that i think hit us pretty hard, but perhaps my wording was sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nI wasn't even worried about myself (I can work my way out of the situation), but more about the impact it can have on new users: while I think you're right in that it will be a minority, it can still be severe for those it hits.\r\n\r\nAnd it's worth seeing how this can happen in unexpected ways:  I was just now working with a colleague who was stumped by this after a conda update.  It turns out that his default browser on OSX is Safari, so after starting `jupyter notebook`, Safari opens for him.  But for Jupyter he prefers Chrome, so he has the reflex to immediately kill/hide Safari and go over to `localhost:8888` on Chrome.\r\n\r\nWell, guess what :)  Now, this puts him on a weird login/password page he'd never seen before, and was stumped.\r\n\r\nFortunately he'd just done the conda update with me in the room and I saw what happened, and was able to help him out.  But it shows that there can be multiple ways in which users can find themselves in this situation that we didn't necessarily foresee...\r\n\r\nIn any case, given that 4.3.1 is near-ready as per @minrk's description above, that sounds like a good amount of info/explanation for most cases.  We can keep collecting feedback on how this impacts the broader user base, and refine our approach.\r\n\r\nBut no, my bugs aren't \"special\", sorry again if it seemed that way.",

It should be considered an 'initial setup' step, rather than an ongoing interaction with the notebook server every time you launch. Resetting cookies will require logging in again. While *browsers* share cookies across ports, we specifically don't use the same cookie for each host:port combination, because different notebook configurations could cause conflicts on the cookie secret. We could consider reversing that, as I think the experience for *most* cases would be better (i.e. all localhost notebooks are actually local). It could cause surprising logout events for anyone who tunnels localhost to remote notebooks, though, or uses temporary config with a fresh cookie secret for testing.",
