I also don't really know how to have something like a link to a release announcement in docs when the release announcement doesn't exist yet.\n\n@willingc what do you think we should do about the what's new copy on the index for 4.2?\n",

I think it is probably better going forward to remove the \"What's new\" from the index page. Instead, we could:\n1. add release upgrade commands to the release notes document\n2. add a link to the blog post (announcement) in the README. It would then be captured in version control but wouldn't need to happen before the release since it's not part of the formal docs.\n\n@minrk What do you think?\n",
