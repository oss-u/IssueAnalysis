    "body": "Hi @sunayhpoole - it seems like your OpenSSL installation got side-affected somehow.  I have found a few instances of this in other unrelated repos and all seem to point to reinstalling or updating OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nTwo of the repos are:  https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli (issue 226) and https://github.com/kelaberetiv/TagUI (issue 86)\r\nHere's an SO hit as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44125147/dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-opt-openssl-lib-libcrypto-1-0-0-dylib\r\n\r\nYou might first try updating your tornado package - since that's where this reference is coming from (indirectly).",
