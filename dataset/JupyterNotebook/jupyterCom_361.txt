    "body": "Hi Carreau -\n\nUpdate this morning. I went to the notebook and tried some extra things before I made my first change. I clicked the Run All right at the outset. I then went into a couple different cells and clicked Run specifically for them. I was testing to see if the commands would break without any editing. They did not.\n\nI then made the change I've described in this issue. I changed the first() function to a count(function). I then clicked Run for that cell. This time, it worked. No NameError.\n\nThe biggest difference I've done this morning is that I specifically clicked the menu Cell > Run All, rather than the \"play\" arrow button which only runs the specific cell. My sense is that the notebook's set of commands are not Run on page load, but await my first time clicking Run All. It was that lack of the initial Run All that caused the NameError of the 'weather' file.\n\nIf so, I've learned a bit about the workings of the Jupyter notebook. Thanks so much for your time and attention.\n\nHutch\n",
