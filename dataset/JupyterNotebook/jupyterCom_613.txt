That is, some kind of cell or notebook item that can contain an arbitrary mimebundle, but which is inserted/deleted independent of code.\n\nInstead  of creating a new cell type, how about adding a flag to `display_data` cells that prevents them from being cleared with other output?  (Of course, you would still need a UI for deleting them, e.g. selecting them and pressing \"delete\" or hitting a close box or something.)
