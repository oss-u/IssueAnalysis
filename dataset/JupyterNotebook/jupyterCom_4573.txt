    "body": "I suspect the in-use ports are a remnant of deleting the environment that you mention in #4572.  \r\n\r\nYou'll likely need to determine which processes are using those ports.  Since this appears to be a Mac, you might try [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421633/who-is-listening-on-a-given-tcp-port-on-mac-os-x) - then issue `kill -9 <PID>`.  (Normally one wouldn't use `-9` (SIGKILL) for this, but I'm fairly certain you don't need these _gracefully exited_.  If that's not the case, remove `-9`, but know they might not go away.)\r\n\r\nRegarding the failure to launch the kernel, I can definitely see that the `kernel.json` I referenced in the other issue probably has an `argv` stanza consisting of `['/anaconda3/envs/py37/bin/python', '-m', 'ipykernel_launcher', '-f', '{connection_file}']`.  Updating the first entry should get you going.",
