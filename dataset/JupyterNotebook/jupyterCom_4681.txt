    "body": "I'm not super familiar with javascript packaging generally, but it looks to me like what happened is that [the latest release of preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat/releases/tag/3.19.0) added a new `createContext` method, which added a new dependency on [`preact-context`](https://github.com/valotas/preact-context), which we're not picking up properly. \r\n\r\nI'm 100% spitballing here, but my *guess* is that the failure to pick up `preact-context` is related to the fact that we're using `bower` for package management, which doesn't know about the transitive dependencies of `preact-compat` (presumably b/c they don't have a bower.json?). \r\n\r\nAssuming the above is correct, what this probably means is that any change that adds a new dependency to any of our bower-unaware dependencies (my guess is that's increasingly the majority of modern js projects given that bower seems to be EOL) will end up being a breaking change for us for as long as we're using bower to manage dependencies.",
