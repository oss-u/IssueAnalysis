It's less clear for nbextensions: they are usually installed and served through Python machinery, but in principle there's nothing Python specific about them, and we may one day regret tying them to Python mechanisms. On the other hand, if server extensions are loaded by entry points, it would be a nice symmetry for nbextensions to use the same, and it would mean that extensions could be cleanly uninstalled with the same tools used to install them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also ties into our discussion on #2824 about moving to a model where installed extensions are automatically loaded unless they have been disabled, rather than requiring an enable step as we currently do.\r\n\r\nSee also my [entrypoints module](http://entrypoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which we're already using in nbconvert.",

I don't think it should necessarily stop us using them (especially because I'm not sure there's any alternative without similar issues), but it's worth being aware of the drawbacks:\r\n\r\n> One that I was helping someone debug just the other day is that they’re super non-debuggable and the behavior when you have two things providing the same entry point is basically ???? (If I remember correctly, the behavior is that the first thing found is the one that “wins”, which means the ordering of sys.path and the names of the projects supply it is what determines it). This got exposed to the end user that they installed something that they thought was going to add support for something, but which silently did nothing because two different project happened to pick the same name for their entry point (not the group, it was two things providing plugins for the same system).\r\n>\r\n> Of course there is the perennial entrypoints are super slow, which is partially the fault of pkg_resources does a bunch of import time logic, but also because scanning sys.path for all installed stuff is just slow.\r\n>\r\n> They’re also somewhat fragile since they rely on the packaging metadata system at runtime, and a number of tools exclude that information (often times things that deploy stuff as a tarball/zipfile) which causes regular issues to be opened up for these projects when they get used in those environments.\r\n>\r\n> Those are the ones I remember because they come up regularly (and people regularly come to me with issues with any project related to packaging in any way even for non packaging related features in those projects). I’m pretty sure there were more of them that I’ve encountered and seen projects encounter, but I can’t remember them to be sure.\r\n\r\nI have some plans to do caching to mitigate the slowness issue (that's partly what the distutils-sig thread is about) - but that's inevitably going to lead to a new kind of problem, with caches getting out of date. We'll have to wait for the implementation to know how big a problem that will be in practice.",
