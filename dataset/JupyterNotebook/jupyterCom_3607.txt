    "body": "I'd like to comment that there is a case where you don't want to have a token, even if it means your system is vulnerable. I know this discussion https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2254 got really heated because it's a huge vulnerability issue, but I believe there are edge cases where managing the token is more work than it's worth.\r\n\r\nWe encapsulate all our data science projects in docker containers. These containers are removed as soon as we exit the container, thus system vulnerability is not a concern, no data is saved on the container themselves. Most of the data exploration we do is in jupyter noteoboks, thus the container serves as an encapsulated configured environment that only runs jupyter notebook, and does so automatically when you start the container.\r\n\r\nUntil I found this solution I and my team had to copy and paste the token from the container repl into a browser every time. which we all saw as an unnecessary step, being behind a corp firewall and ultimately not concerned about someone messed with our running containers. So thanks for this solution!",
