This problem has been happening for a while for quite a lot of people.\r\nBut if you want to use the jupyter notebook in your organisation's network...you can do using the gcp notebook instance..its pretty straight forward. I'm using that as a back up if the problem comes again in my old GCP instance. The AI platform notebook instance doesn't show any kind of connection error because it doesn't really use private port or port specified by the user...and also the installation and set are done by google itself, so there shouldn't be any problem. I'm using it currently and it works perfectly for me.\r\n\r\nBut if you're comfortable using the R studio, its up to you.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nArav",

    "body": "Hi @rachel662 - I would check the `argv:` stanza of the R kernel's `kernel.json` file and ensure it's pointing to a valid `R` program.  To locate the `kernel.json` file, issue `jupyter kernelspec list` from the command line, locate the name of the R kernel in the column on the left and its directory in the column on the right.  In there should be the `kernel.json` file.  \r\n\r\nFWIW, mine looks as follows (running on a Mac OS):\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"argv\": [\"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R\", \"--slave\", \"-e\", \"IRkernel::main()\", \"--args\", \"{connection_file}\"],\r\n  \"display_name\": \"R\",\r\n  \"language\": \"R\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould you still encounter issues, it might be a good idea to include the output of the notebook server's console in a follow-up comment as connection issues have many manifestations.",
