    "body": "@jskDr Currently, JupyterLab provides a CSVWidget for viewing CSV data. Additionally, I am actively developing [jupyterlab_table](https://github.com/gnestor/jupyterlab_table) which is an interactive table for viewing CSV files and tabular data (pandas DataFrames) outputs in the notebook (both classic notebook and jupyterlab). I plan on adding features to this project such as editing and charting. jupyterlab_table uses the [Data Package spec](http://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package) and I just discovered [this package](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-render-js) last week that looks like a way to render a Data Packages using Vega, Plotly, Recline, Handson, and react-virtualized (which is the renderer that is currenly implemented), so it might be trivial to add these rendering options. I suggest opening an issue on jupyterlab_table :+1:",
