    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIf you're referring to this [pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/), `pip install jupyter` is a metapackage that merely ensures at least _some version_ of [these packages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/blob/master/setup.py#L27-L32) are installed.  As a result, if you already had Notebook 5.7 installed, it would do nothing to that installation.\r\n\r\n[Notebook releases are fairly regular](https://pypi.org/project/notebook/#history), although its been a few months.  5.7.8 was made available in April and, just last week, the 6.0.0rc1 pre-release was produced.  As a result, you might instead try updating the package directly (e.g., `pip install  --upgrade notebook`).  This should update your environment to Notebook 5.7.8.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the [jupyter repo](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter), I get the impression its for the initial seeding of a system primary jupyter components and general documentation. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps.",
