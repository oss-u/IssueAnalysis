Realistically, the Notebook is still heavily used and needs maintainers, so having some maintainers here is likely necessary.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we need to answer the question, what is the status of Jupyter Notebook repo: \r\n1. **actively maintained**—accepting features; needs established team of reviewers and maintainers\r\n2. **maintenance-only mode**—only accepting bug fixes; also needs established team of reviewers and maintainers (but likely less people). We would, then, close all PRs that try to add features with appropriate messaging.\r\n3. **end-of-life**—archive the notebook repo and redirect people to other Jupyter projects like nteract, lab, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n ",

For example, here is all the open issues with more than 40 interactions:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+interactions%3A%3E40+is%3Aopen\r\n\r\nThis provides a nice overview of the things are users care deeply about.",
