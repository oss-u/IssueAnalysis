    "body": "Hi @virejdasani - thank you for this contribution!  I am unable to review these changes as I don't know how to read Chinese or Hindi but there are some changes that will be necessary prior to its merge.\r\n\r\n- The language and country codes are not correct.  These correspond to the 'ch-CH' and 'hin-HIN' directory names that contain the translated files.  I believe we're trying to follow the [ISO 639 (language codes)](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) and [ISO 3166 (country codes)](http://kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html) standards for specifying these, which, together, essentially comprise the user's _locale_.\r\n\r\n- For Chinese translations, the language code is 'zh' and you'll typically see a country code of 'CN' (for mainland China) or 'TW' (for Taiwan) (there are also 'HK' - Hong Kong and 'SG' - Singapore, etc.)  The 'CH' country code actually corresponds to Switzerland.  \r\n\r\n    Please relocate your Chinese-translated files to a 'zh-CN' directory (or one of the other country codes if more appropriate).\r\n\r\n- While 'hin' is a valid language code for Hindi, I think we should stick with the two-character codes and use 'hi'.  Since Hindi is not a country, we need to identify a particular region/country to which we can map your Hindi translations.  Looking at a list of Hindi-speaking countries, I suspect that the India country code 'IN' would be the appropriate indicator.  Nepal's country code (which has the second-largest number of Hindi-speaking people) is 'NP' (in case that's more appropriate). \r\n\r\n    Please relocate your Hindi-translated files to a 'hi-IN' directory (or use a different country code as appropriate).\r\n\r\n- Also, please update the title to indicate that Hindi translations are also included.",

Looking at the [FAQ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq), this doesn't appear necessary for you to receive credit:\r\n>Do issues have to be tagged #Hacktoberfest to count?\r\nNo, any pull request made on a public repository counts, whether it’s attached to a hacktoberfest issue or not.\r\n\r\nso I'm inclined to continue performing the usual merge operations.  We really appreciate your contribution and hope you continue to improve the Jupyter ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nIf other maintainers know of what steps to perform to accommodate things like Hactoberfest, please comment.
