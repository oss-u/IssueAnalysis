    "body": "> why does the notebook lack this functionality\n\nPartly because unlimited undoing is a much more complex subject when the document is executable.\nWhich is the case with the notebook.\n\nExample : if i do `a=1`, execute, `a=2`, execute, and undo what am I suppose to undo ? The execution ? \n\nThen you enter question like : Can the execution be undone ? Can it be undone reliably across languages ? What if other code is currently being ran ?.... etc, and I just scratch the surface. \n\nOther part : we assessed the benefit/cost ratio, and decided that with the current manpower/usage/cost/number-of-features-needed/current-architecture it was not worth implementing, at least yet.\n\nThis can of course change if there is a change in any of the above mentioned factor, especially if we get more help for code maintenance.\n\nI'm closing as the multiple undo has already a few issues where it is discussed, but feel free to continue adding comments to this issues if you like. \n\nThanks.\n",
