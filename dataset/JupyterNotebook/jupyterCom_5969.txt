    "body": "Hello @orlandoandradeb.  I'm not familiar with PyCharm's Jupyter integration, but your problem's description implies that the target kernel and the running notebook server (presumably started by PyCharm) are probably in different python environments.\r\n\r\nI see the tab name (which I assume is the kernel name) of `Python [conda env:ambientequetzal]`.  This looks like a kernel name produced by [nb_conda_kernels](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels) which overrides the default kernel spec manager with their own to essentially allow for kernels to span environments.  As a result, there could be something related to that.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to run `jupyter kernelspec list` from the environment in which you're experiencing this issue and locate the directory of the kernel you're having issues with.  Then check that directory's `kernel.json` file and ensure its `argv` stanza is pointing a valid command.",
