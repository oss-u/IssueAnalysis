One of the issues with looking into milestone is that regular folks (e.g. even me) cannot set that property on an issue or pr. \r\n\r\nCouple things I was considering:\r\n* There are at least a few old deprecations on the code, which says it should be cleaned in 6.0. Should we actually remove those before the release (e.g. IPython js variable says it is deprecated since 4.0 and should be removed in 5+, but it seems a few tests are still referencing it)\r\n* There seems to be a lot of new PRs around Accessibility, I believe those can be actually added into a minor release (e.g. 6.0.1) but wanted to ask what others think.\r\n* There are other few PRs that would be good to be merged before 6.0 (#4701 #4576)",
