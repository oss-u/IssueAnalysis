    "body": "Hi @whllnd !\r\n\r\nThat sounds like what it's expected to do. When you run `jupyter notebook` and it opens a browser for you, it passes the token to that browser in the URL (actually it's a separate token which only works a single time). The browser uses the token to get a cookie, and a redirect means you can't see the token in the address bar.\r\n\r\nWhen you open it in a second browser, it's not authenticated, so you see the login page.\r\n\r\nIf you right click on the Jupyter logo in the browser that is already authenticated, you can use 'copy link' to get a link which includes the token. Paste that into another browser, and it bypasses the login page.",
