The `port-retries` configurable option _is_ what instructs the server to not attempt to locate a different port so we might as well use it. \r\n\r\n> The info and error messages are already sensitive to port-retries==0.\r\n\r\nBy this I meant that the _messaging_ would be different when port-retries==0.  For example, we probably shouldn't indicate that we're trying another port when retries are disabled and we should probably produce a different error message that say's we failed to start because \"port X was not available\" rather than implying we couldn't find any port.",
