I'm pretty sure I understand the use case for the cull-busy flag (to allow a single cell's execution to exceed the idle period - correct?) but I guess I'm not following the cull-connected case.  I figured the kernel was always in a connected state.  Seems like this case would be covered by the prior culling feature - in conjunction with cull-busy.  Could you please clarify the use cases for these flags?  Just trying to minimize knobs here.  Thanks!",

    "body": "The connection count tracked by the API is actually how many *clients* are connected to the kernel via the notebook API. My thinking is that in some situations, you may not want to cull a kernel that has a browser tab open pointing at the associated notebook, even if the kernel is idle (e.g., kiosk mode). In others, you may want to cull regardless of whether there are connected clients or not (e.g., users at work forget they have tabs open). `cull_connected` is the knob to handle these two use cases. `cull_busy` handles the situation you described above.\r\n\r\nAt work, I plan to configure our JupyterHub instances to `cull_busy=False`, `cull_connected=True` such that users with long running jobs (e.g., Spark) won't lose work if they exceed the idle period, but browser tabs left open over the weekend won't keep kernels alive once they go idle.",
