    "body": "> i don't understand why notebooks not rendering is such a consistent problem.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are referring to notebooks rendering on GitHub. If so, please file an issue with GitHub. We do not have any control over notebooks rendering on GitHub.\r\n\r\n> Notebooks are not designed for version control, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThis is a separate issue than GitHub rendering notebooks. Two interesting ways of having version control and notebooks are:\r\n\r\n1. Use nbdime to diff between notebooks. You can hook it into your vcs as well:https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vcs.html\r\n2. Use Jupytext to save notebooks in plain text instead of JSON, which works very well with version control: https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext",
