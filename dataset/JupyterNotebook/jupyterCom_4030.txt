    "body": "Thanks for the PR! So sorry for not reviewing this for so long. This shouldn't have needed a change to the Python API at all I believe (and this contains backward-incompatible changes such as removing the `new_untitled` method). We already have a \"new entity\" method, it's called `new` and we have an API for it (PUT to a path). I think this can be replaced with purely a javascript change to use PUT after prompting instead of any of the `new_entity` changes.",
