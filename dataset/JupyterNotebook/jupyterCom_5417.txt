It looks as though your notebook server is binding to the port, but not getting far enough along during startup to produce the file used by the `stop` (and `list`) subcommands.\r\n\r\nDid your first attempt exit or did you have to control-C to unblock (although not evident in the screenshot)?  It seems your subsequent attempt has blocked as well - and probably having similar issues, but against port 8889.\r\n\r\nIf you can try to get a traceback of where things are stuck, that might provide some clues.  Not sure if launching with `--debug` will produce any additional information, but worth a try.",
