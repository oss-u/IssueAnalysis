Should work in 5.0 and maybe the extension needs tweaks for Notebook 5.1 . This should be the optimal way to add buttons to dashboard using Jupyter.notebook object as shown.\r\n\r\n* [recommended blog](https://mindtrove.info/4-ways-to-extend-jupyter-notebook/)\r\n   - Point#2 This one looks deprecated.\r\n   - Point#3 Jupyter Notebook extensions (nbextensions) same as the one listed above, has the `nb` in it, probably same as `nbserver_extensions`\r\n   - Point#4 Notebook Server Extensions Is this the `server_extension` ? Or have `server_extensions` been removed from the docs and blogs. \r\n* Superficially read `notebook.nbextensions` and `notebook.serverextensions` and still confused.\r\nThe docs probably do not clearly specify as of now which one of it is which.\r\nPlease tell me if I am moving in the right direction. Thanks a lot. \r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do?\r\n- Add some functionality to make interaction with git&github easier from the front-end. I am not getting very helpful messages in the browser's JavaScript console, which points to some main.min.js.\r\n- I can bring up buttons by writing JavaScript in the Notebook cell with the `%%javascript` magic-flags. I can't figure out if the `.js` file has to be in `~/.jupyer/custom/custom.js` or `~/.local/share/jupyter/nbextensions`. \r\n\r\nNewbie so far,\r\nvharsh on Freenode",
