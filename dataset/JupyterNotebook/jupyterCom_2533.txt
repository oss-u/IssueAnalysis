    "body": "Nice! This idea first emerged a few months ago in my work with\n@cameronoelsen on JupyterLab. Here is one of the recent issues on the idea:\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2109\n\nI have some earlier mockups about the idea as well, but can find them right\nnow. My preference is for us to iterate on these types of design ideas in\nJupyterLab and then back port them to classic notebook if it makes sense. I\nwould like to avoid getting into a situation where we are trying to\nsimultaneously do similar but different design work on the same UI elements\nin classic notebook and lab.\n\nBut overall +1 on the idea of having a per cell run button and using the\nprompt area in some manner for it. This idea is also related to other\nquestions:\n\n* Are we going to change the actual In/Out prompt text?\n* How we we offer this type of UI without having N play buttons shown on\nthe page? (hover? selected cell only?)\n* Should we hide the play button if the cell was just run and is not in the\ndirty state?\n\nLet's continue this discussion over on lab...\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1742\nhttps://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1692\nhttps://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2109\n\n\nOn Wed, May 31, 2017 at 3:39 AM, Thomas Kluyver <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Nice!

We are now at release 5.0, and things are not getting any better on the usability front. I think we need to remove stuff, not add new features. Anyway just my 2c...\r\n\r\n",
