The notebook is currently in support-mode meaning that we are not adding many new features and focused primarily on fixing bugs. See [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) for future notebook development. However, we are always welcoming of new contributors, so if you would like to submit a PR to improve the current behavior, then by all means, go for it!",
