    "body": "It helps with that particular use case, but even then, whenever the next cell is huge, scrolling to the _bottom_ of it doesn't seem like the correct behavior for shift-enter. I still think that after shift-enter, for large cells, the top of the next cell (not the bottom, should be visible). \n\nIf the idea is to minimize the amount of scrolling one has to do (so that executing puts you where you would expect) maybe control-enter should make sure the output is visible? If the current cell is large, and I'm editing some settings at the top of it, then it similarly breaks the flow of the modify/run/check output cycle if I have to scroll to see the output plot. \n\nThe fact that with the current behavior there are cases where, no matter which execution method you use, you can't see the output without manually scrolling suggests to me that the alternative that I proposed would still improve user experience.\n\nI realize this is work so I can jump on it myself, but I'd like feedback on whether you guys agree that this would be a positive change first.\n",

You can see that when I am in a \"long\" cell (i.e. one in which the output extends past the bottom of the screen), the browser view does not advance to the currently-selected cell. This makes using the notebook rather disorienting, making it difficult to move through a notebook, as it forces me to use the up-down arrow to advance the browser to the appropriate view.
