After a few hours intact, it will fail again.\n\n---\n\nso let’s give some technical background: “Plot with(out) title” is the text representation emitted by the IRkernel, but unless configured otherwise, it’ll also emit a PNG representation.\n\nif that one isn’t displayed, either\n- IRkernel doesn’t create it (e.g. because it’s configured to only emit text. i don’t see how that can happen accidentally, and survive a kernel reboot but not a notebook restart)\n- IRkernel doesn’t send it (would be strange because it gets handled a list with all representations and converts it to JSON, then sent as one blob)\n- notebook doesn’t receive it (it’s stripped out somewhere along the way)\n- notebook doesn’t display it (because the text format is the only one, it’s configured to display text rather than PNG using display_priority, or because displaying PNG errors somehow)\n",
