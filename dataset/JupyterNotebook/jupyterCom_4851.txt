    "body": "Hi @ietuday.  I think we're going to need more information to help with this.  Since you didn't get a clear error message, I suspect the kernel _process_ has started and appears alive (from the notebook server's perspective), but there's an issue with completing the startup.\r\n\r\nThere may be information on the console on which `juptyer notebook` was performed (or, preferably a redirect file).  If that doesn't show anything useful, I recommend restarting notebook with debug enabled (e.g., `jupyter notebook --debug ...`) and try starting the kernel again.  Once in this position, please provide **all** output from the start of the notebook's startup to the end of its output.  Hopefully some golden nuggets will be present.  I would also recommend waiting 30-60 seconds after the kernel start request to capture the log output, just in case there's a timeout condition met, etc.",
