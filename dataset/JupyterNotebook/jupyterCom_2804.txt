    "body": "I was able to have some level of success with these translations.  But there are some things that weren't quite right..... Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n1). The translated files are really .po, not .pot ( although the format is the same ), so I renamed them.\r\n2). Put the translated notebook.po and nbui.po into notebook/i18n/zh-CN/LC_MESSAGES.\r\n3). Run pybabel compile to create Chinese notebook.mo and nbui.mo in notebook/i18n/zh-CN/LC_MESSAGES per the instructions.\r\n4). Run po2json to create Chinese nbjs.json in notebook/i18n/zh-CN/LC_MESSAGES\r\n5). Update notebook/i18n/nbjs.json to add \"zh-CN\" to the list of supported languages.\r\n6). Update notebook/static/base/js/i18nload.js per the instructions in the comment:\r\n\r\n         // These are only here so that the optimizer knows which ones we MIGHT load.\r\n\t // We will actually only load the ones we need. There should be one entry\r\n\t // here for each language you want to support.\r\n\t // For example, for German....\r\n\t \"json!base/../../i18n/zh-CN/LC_MESSAGES/nbjs.json\"\r\n\r\n7). Regenerate the javascript with \"setup.py css js\"\r\n8). Set your language to zh-CN and your browser default to zh-cn.\r\nRun jupyter notebook.....\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering, the reason we're using zh-CN instead of just zh is that moment doesn't have a \"zh\" locale, only \"zh-cn\" and \"zh-tw\", so the date stuff won't come out right if you try to use just \"zh\".\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4491110/30603118-2ea5ee76-9d2c-11e7-8036-76bc2b958b99.png)\r\n\r\nSome things to be noted:\r\n\r\n1). There are a number of places where the English has changed since my original drop, so in order to completely do this right, you would need to update the English using pybabel extract in the instructions, and then translate the updated files.\r\n\r\n2). There are some places where the translations were incomplete or missing items.\r\n\r\nBut overall, these files seem to work OK and produce reasonable amounts of Chinese.",
