Is there any way to allow keyboard navigation without blocking that? Or are the two absolutely in conflict?\r\n\r\nI was also thinking about the original indentation function, but I think they are in conflict.\r\nI tried to set the \"tabindex\" attribute to make the CodeMirror editor and other elements to different levels. But the focus still going to the editor directly.\r\nThe disable of the \"Tab\", \"Shift\" and \"Shift+Tab\" keymap will only affect the CodeMirror editor in \"Edit Metadata\" modal dialog.\r\n\r\nHere is a link from CodeMirror repo I think is similar to our issue #4012: https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/5444",
