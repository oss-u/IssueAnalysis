    "body": "When the connection is closed due to closing the browser tab, the buffering logic is triggered and buffered messages are discarded when the same running notebook is opened in a subsequent tab.  \r\n\r\nHowever, my experiences with the network connection drops is that the buffering logic is NOT triggered AND any messages not initially displayed as the result of the network drop DO get displayed upon the network's enablement.  During this entire period, however, none of the buffered message logic is performed.  This leads me to believe the 'buffering' is occurring at the ZMQ level.\r\n\r\nBoth of these scenarios are clear when debug logging is enabled.  Please try your scenarios with `--debug` or `--log-level=DEBUG` enabled on the command line.\r\n\r\nI've added an example of the buffered message output to #4110 .",
