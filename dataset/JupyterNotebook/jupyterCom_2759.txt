Some of us(including me), being avid users of Jupyter Notebook suggested that we choose an issue in this repository.\r\n\r\nBeing new contributors we searched for issues labelled as \"good first issue\" and came across this issue and it really piqued our interest. We are third year CSE students with technical background in fields related to the tech stack of this repo.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to work on one of these issues at first and also, some advice regarding which issue to work on. We are really hyped to get this work done and will sincerely appreciate your guidance. Please tell us how to proceed and what we can do in this issue.",
