    "body": "In general, we have found that in almost all cases, adding explicit scrolling of the notebook causes more pain that resolving it. We are currently dealing with these things in JupyterLab as well, but we have been able to design a more flexible set of APIs for controlling these things in a fine grained manner. But even there, most of the explicit focus calls have had to be removed because of the problems they were causing. We are open to improvements, but they would need to be tested very extensively in different situations, including: large input, large output, where the cell is on the page, focus changing with the keyboard versus mouse, etc.",
