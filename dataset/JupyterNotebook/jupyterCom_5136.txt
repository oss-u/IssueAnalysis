I believe the permission message is fine as-is - although I suppose one could argue that it too should include the 'trying another port` clause (only when retries are enabled).   That said, you typically want to provide only the necessary information in security-related messaging, so perhaps leaving that one alone is probably best given it didn't include the clause in the first place.",
