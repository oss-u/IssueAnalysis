Those end users are going to vary in skill and use cases.\n\nClarity and concrete points are most helpful in the README. I recommend that we work toward the 80/20 rule. Try to cover 80% of the typical users in the README and link the other 20% to more detailed information in the project documentation. Thank you. :penguin: \n",
