Be sure to reboot the browser after installing it & shit Shift-Alt-M to launch it. Hit the Tool thingy (wrench icon) & and disable the Keyboard shortcut. It's now better than Chrome, which I had problem with Keras update. I will share more as I figure it out, but now the main issue is solved.\r\nI still have issues with Ctrl-Shft-_ splitting the cell & few others but... this is much better.

That should take care of the `Ctrl-Shit-_`. It also fixes `Ctrl+Y` so it doesn't highlight after yank, adds `Ctrl+n/p` navigation to move around cells, and allows you to paste from system clipboard using `Ctrl+V`. For fun, I also added `M-x` to show the command pallete.\r\n\r\nI'll add to the documentation about that extension for firefox users :)",
