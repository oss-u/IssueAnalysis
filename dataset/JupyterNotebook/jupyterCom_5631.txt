    "body": "Hi @Ashwin-gx - this is a duplicate of [several issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+secure_write+ALLOW).  I would first recommend upgrading your `jupyter_client` package, which should also update your `jupyter_core` package (where the `secure_write()` method now lives).  Once you upgrade, restart the notebook server and reattempt the kernel startup.  I suspect you'll probably have the same issue, but the error message should resemble that described in #5197.  To get around this issue, take a look at this comment - which provides a couple of work arounds:  https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5197#issuecomment-586614351",
