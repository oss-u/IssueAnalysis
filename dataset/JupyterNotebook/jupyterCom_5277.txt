    "body": "Hi @MORNIIN - welcome to the world of programming and, specifically, the Jupyter Community!\r\n\r\nYou're bumping into a common problem as of late, so \"it's not you\".  The first step to troubleshooting this issue is to get you up on the latest version of Notebook.  I recommend you stop the notebook server (control-C twice in the command window is the normal approach), then do either of the following to upgrade Notebook (and its dependencies)...\r\n\r\n`pip install notebook --upgrade`\r\n\r\nor, for conda envs,\r\n\r\n`conda update -c conda-forge notebook`\r\n\r\nOnce completed, you should find that `jupyter_client` and `jupyter_core` have versions >= `5.3.4` and >= `4.6.1`, respectively.  The version check is most easily accomplished using `pip freeze`, then locating the modules in the output. \r\n\r\nOnce updated, start your Notebook server instance (e.g., `jupyter notebook`) and try starting a kernel again.  If the problem still persists, please provide the updated traceback information similar to what you provided previously.  The screenshots, for this issue, are not required - although appreciated down the road for other issues.",
