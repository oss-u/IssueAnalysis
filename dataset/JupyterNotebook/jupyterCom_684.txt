I added back in the call to `command_mode` since I realized it actually did get called multiple times before (once in `execute_cell_range` and once each time `execute_cell` was called), so now it gets executed twice (once in `execute_cell_range` and once in `execute_cells`). I am not sure if it is really necessary to call the command mode function inside the loop, though I can have it do that, too, if necessary.\n",
