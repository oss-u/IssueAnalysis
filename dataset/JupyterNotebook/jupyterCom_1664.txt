The website repo is [there](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter.github.io), once this work we can see for modifications.\r\n\r\nIf you like to make that on the notebook, the simplest if first to get this current repo on your computer, and managed to install a development version of the notebook. You should be able to find the documentation [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/). Once this is done you can start to make local modifications :-) \r\n\r\nOne thing that would be great, is while you are doing this: when you find something unclear, hard, or just don't know where to search, take notes and tell us afterward, that will help us to improve the documentation a bit more for the next contributor. \r\n\r\nIf you have more questions, feel fre to ask.

    "body": "Hey @Carreau, I finished up my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering this past May. Still looking for a job but my internship experiences worked with a single page web application and a lot of IPython Notebooks with pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. Like I mentioned earlier, new to open source but looking to be an involved contributor to a project and this seemed like a good fit given my familiarity with Jupyter from projects.\r\n\r\nSo it took a little time but I managed to get the website working on my local machine. It'd be nice to work on the notebook too so I'll try to have that setup over the next few days.\r\n\r\nSome notes on the setup process for the website (note: I had no prior experience with Ruby, Gems, etc.):\r\n\r\n- Installing Ruby and the DevKit was straightforward and I had no issues following the docs\r\n\r\n- Installing github-pages and some other dependencies on a Windows 64-bit machine required some work. It might help to mention in the [Readme](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter.github.io#quick-local-testing) to run `bundle install` to execute the Gemfile already included in the project. At one point I made a Gemfile in the Devkit directory.\r\n\r\n- I ran into the following error: `You have already activated json 2.0.3, but your Gemfile requires json 1.8.6. Prepending 'bundle exec' to your command may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)`\r\nI couldn't get past this by specifying `gem 'json', '1.8.6'` in the Gemfile so I have to run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''` to serve the project to localhost.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was not much trouble to get setup with the website. Could you provide some more specifics or next steps to add this welcome message (what message to output, where some of the core logic that I might be working with is located, etc)? I'll try to familiarize myself with the project structure in the meantime. Thanks!",
