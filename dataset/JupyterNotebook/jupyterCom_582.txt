Is it missing functionality issue or just the fact that base image would be different. I think I have seen the encoding issues, but believe I have a way to resolve them.\n\n> though I'm increasingly wondering how much the `jupyter/notebook` base image even makes sense at all.\n\nFrom my perspective, it is nice because it includes the latest build of the `notebook` codebase. This will be very handling combined with CI ( https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/547 ) to verify that this medium of distribution still works. It also allows for others to base their image off this one and take advantage of the latest changes by using repository links ( https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/ ). Taking advantage of Docker Hub's ability to build tags ( https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/593 ) will allow proper versions to be built and released from here. Having the latest release of code in a working environment could also be used to provide others a simple working test/development environment.\n\nFinally, as this image becomes more robust and compatible, it only makes sense that it will take the place of the minimal notebook ( https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/minimal-notebook/Dockerfile ) by eliminating all, or at least most, of its need. This will become the base image and allow for the latest changes to be propagated downstream to other configurations ( https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks ). Pinning the version of `notebook` by using tags of this build will also be an option.\n",

To me, it's primarily a source of documentation for a simple install and/or the simplest example deployment. I would specifically _not_ use it as a general base image, where I would always want to be using conda, install more packages, etc. This seems to what we are accomplishing with docker-stacks, so I wouldn't do it here. Perhaps this file should be removed entirely, and we ensure we have a sensible minimal base image in jupyter/docker-stacks that we point `jupyter/notebook` to on Docker Hub.\n",
