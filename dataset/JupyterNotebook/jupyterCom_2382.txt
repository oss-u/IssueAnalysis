    "body": "OK - so, I looked into this a little bit, and I don't believe that it's a bug, it's intended behavior. See here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/tree/handlers.py#L44\r\n\r\nSo clearly `notebook` explicitly is not allowing hidden folders. I played around with getting this to work and it seems like it'd be non-trivial to add support for hidden folders (somebody correct me if I'm wrong). So, I think the real problem here is that the error messages you get when starting from hidden folders are not helpful. From the user's perspective it feels like a bug and isn't clarified as intended, which is why folks are getting frustrated here.\r\n\r\nA few ideas that could help this:\r\n\r\n1. In the error message that is logged, rather than on top of saying \"Refusing to serve hidden directory\" I'd add \"(hidden directories not yet supported)\" or something along these lines.\r\n2. In the 404 page the notebook throws, what if we added some more useful information there, so instead of just\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% extends \"error.html\" %}\r\n{% block error_detail %}\r\n<p>You are requesting a page that does not exist!</p>\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe added a short list of possible fixes below that are common to jupyter, so the page looks something like:\r\n\r\n---\r\nYou are requesting a page that does not exist!\r\n\r\n_The following steps might help:_\r\n\r\n1. Did you type in or click on a URL? Make sure there are no type-os and the path is correct.\r\n2. Are you attempting to access a hidden folder? Hidden folders are not supported with the Notebook UI.\r\n3. ....anything else?\r\n---\r\n\r\nThoughts? @takluyver and maybe @minrk has thoughts too? Let me know and then I will clarify this issue title/top-level comment (or I'll open a PR and turn this issue into a feature request)",

    "body": "It is certainly by design - the original motivating example was the `.ssh` folder storing your private ssh keys. Refusing to serve files from hidden folders makes it a bit harder for potential attackers to get that information or to e.g. add themself to the authorized keys for ssh-ing in. It's still possible through running a kernel, but there are some classes of attack where HTTP requests would be possible but controlling a kernel would not. This is defence in depth: if an outer layer of security is imperfect, it limits what someone can do.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we could relax it a bit. In particular, if you've launched the notebook from a hidden folder, you probably want to serve that folder (possibly you don't think of it as hidden). So we could refuse to serve hidden *subfolders* within the starting directory, but not check the starting directory itself.\r\n\r\nFor the record, part of the reason we haven't been paying attention to this is that while *Anaconda* has been getting a lot of issues filed about this and linking to this issue, this issue itself has only been getting a couple of comments a month. I don't get notifications from Anaconda issues, so I didn't see all those related issues until I came to this page. That's not anyone's fault, it's just one of those things that happens.",
