    "body": "I found a solution that may not solve the problem generally, but works for my situation. In my situation, I print the message myself at the beginning of a function, do some work, and then erase the message before exiting the function. So, I just pass '\\r' to the \"end\" parameter of the Python print function when I initially print the message, to reset the cursor to the beginning of the line. Then, when I'm ready to erase the message, I print as many spaces as there were characters in the message, to overwrite the it. I also end that print with a '\\r'. It looks like this:\r\n~~~~\r\nmessage = \"cool message!!\"\r\nprint(message, end='\\r')\r\n# Do some work\r\nprint(\" \" * len(message), end='\\r')\r\n~~~~\r\nIf someone had a situation where they weren't controlling the printing of the line they wanted to erase, this wouldn't work. That said, I'm closing the issue.",
