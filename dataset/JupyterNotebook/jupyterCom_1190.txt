    "body": "Yes that works just fine for what I need. I just thought it might be easy\nwith all the other shortcuts already implemented and it being in its own\npop-up box. But of note when you toggle the all code blocks or just the\nselected code blocks with space it seems to send you to the replace instead\nof the seach. The other two send you to replace but maybe because when you\ntoggle that it runs a check even if the fiels are empty and says nothing is\nmatching. Anyways tahnks for the help.\n\nOn Thu, Mar 10, 2016 at 3:30 AM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Likely possible but not too easy.\n> \n> I would suggest using Shift-Tab/Space to toggle the button.
