    "body": "So @jhamrick just helped me figure out what was going on. \n\nThe problem is that the kernelspec has a deprecated command, so while the first time you run jupyter notebook it does migrate your settings, it doesn't upgrade you to non-deprecated versions of the ipython kernel commands. So this issues shouldn't up in non-ipython kernels.\n\nIf you want to see the contents of the files where this is specified you can use:\n`cat /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2/kernel.json`\nor\n`cat ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python3/kernel.json`\n\nswapping out python2 or python3 depending on where you've installed them (apparently `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels` are where global kernels are stored and `~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/` are where user specific kernels are stored. \n\nFor example, my old `python2/kernel.json` read as follows\n\n```\n{\n\"display_name\": \"Python 2\",\n\"language\": \"python\",\n\"argv\": [\n    \"/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7\",\n    \"-m\",\n    \"IPython.kernel\",\n    \"-f\",\n    \"{connection_file}\"\n]\n}\n```\n\nand my  old `python3/kernel.json` read as:\n\n```\n{\n\"display_name\": \"IPython (Python 3)\",\n\"language\": \"python\",\n\"argv\": [\n    \"python3\",\n    \"-c\", \"from IPython.kernel.zmq.kernelapp import main; main()\",\n    \"-f\", \"{connection_file}\"\n],\n\"codemirror_mode\": {\n    \"version\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"ipython\"\n}\n}\n```\n\nTo fix it run `jupyter kernelspec install-self --user` which will fix the incorrect command to `ipykernel`\n\nSo that afterward the Python3 `kernel.json` reads:\n\n`cat ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python3/kernel.json`\n\n```\n{\n\"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n\"language\": \"python\",\n\"argv\": [\n    \"/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.4\",\n    \"-m\",\n    \"ipykernel\",\n    \"-f\",\n    \"{connection_file}\"\n]\n}\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n{\n\"display_name\": \"Python 2\",\n\"language\": \"python\",\n\"argv\": [\n    \"/Users/michaelpacer/envs/jupyterpy2/bin/python2.7\",\n    \"-m\",\n    \"ipykernel\",\n    \"-f\",\n    \"{connection_file}\"\n]\n}\n```\n\nWhere the `python2` path goes to a virtualenv installed version of python since you need to run the `jupyter kernelspec install-self --user` command from a version of the `jupyter` that was installed using `python2` to update the `python2` kernel  (or conversely `python3` to update the `python3` kernel). Because my main python is `python3` from which I installed my global version of `jupyter`, that's why it has a non-virtualenv version of `python3` in its path.\n\nAnyway — I dunno if this will fix all your problems, but this should at least make those warnings go away. \n",
