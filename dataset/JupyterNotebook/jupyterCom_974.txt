We can always remove after the UI change lands.\n\nYour point on changes over time is well taken. The rule of thumb that I am working under is adding a GIF or image should directly impact the reader's understanding. In general, I love things like the Tour of the Notebook to help users become familiar with features.\n\nWelcome back :D \n",
