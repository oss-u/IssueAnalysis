In this case, we'd probably want the code that performs the update in an @observe decorator - but that's future stuff (see [ipython/traitlets#521](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/521) and [ipython/traitlets#522](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/522)). This would allow admins encountering 'Too Many Open Files' to at least extend the server's life while addressing the (probable) underlying issue.\r\n\r\nGood point too!",
