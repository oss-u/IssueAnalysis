Try `ipython kernelspec list` to see.\r\n\r\nI tried to follow @msukmanowsky 's example to add something like `\"--profile=my-profile\"` to my kernel.json created when I created a conda env. It is located at `~/anaconda/envs/<env-name>/share/jupyter/kernels/python3`. However, when launching a Jupyter notebook server and a notebook, and selecting the desired kernel, it did not appear that the profile was activated or that any startup files in `~/.ipython/<profile_name>/ipython/startup/*` were run. I believe the _right_ way to do this currently is using ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py, but I couldn't get code there to run either.\r\n\r\nWhat _did_ work was to use a cell magic `%run ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/startup.ipy`.

Right now the wording regarding kernelspecs in the \"Migrating from IPython\" page is sorely lacking, because the docs go from talking about profiles to talking about kernelspecs and I would bet that most people don't know what the kernelspec is or that it is the key thing you must change.
