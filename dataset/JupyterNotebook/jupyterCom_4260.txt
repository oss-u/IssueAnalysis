    "body": "Thanks for the PR! I've tested this locally (on mac) and it works great.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do about the long-term token. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. on certain shared-user systems (mostly linux), clicking the link could result in a process with the token on the command-line, which can be snooped by other users on the system (well-known issue on shared machines)\r\n2. this file approach would work great locally, but it would be *super* inconvenient for containers/remote servers\r\n3. this is only an issue when the user's browser is on a shared system (i.e. it doesn't matter if the remote machine where the server actually is is shared)\r\n\r\nOne option is to use this file approach with the long-term token (~useless for the container/remote case). Another option is to not make the URL copy/pasteable, only the url and token separately. Then users cannot open the link by clicking it, they must open the not authenticated url and then paste the token into the login form. We've basically had this in certain cases on and off. One thing's for certain, though: if we make the URL not clickable/pasteable, even for security reasons, folks are going to be annoyed at the resulting inconvenience, as we have seen in #3605 and friends. Yet another option is to put a disclaimer next to the link, saying that it should be copied/pasted, not click-to-open. Maybe the last one is best. What do you think?",

    "body": "I've also tested it locally on Linux. It would be good for someone to check on Windows, but so long as `pathname2url` from the standard library does its job correctly, it should work there too.\r\n\r\nFor presentation in the terminal, how about something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTo access the notebook, open this file in a browser:\r\n    file:///path/to/file.html\r\nOr copy and paste one of these URLs:\r\n    http://localhost:8888/?token=faec...\r\n    http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=faec...\r\n\r\nIf other users are logged in to this computer, don't click the http URLs in the terminal\r\n  More info: http://jupyter.something\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm 50/50 on the message at the end. On the one hand, it seems fair to let the security conscious know that this might matter. But many users aren't going to read it anyway, and for most of those who would, it doesn't matter, so it's just an extra thing to think about and worry about.",
