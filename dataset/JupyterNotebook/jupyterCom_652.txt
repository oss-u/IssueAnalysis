    "body": "There are millions of Jupyter Notebooks in the wild now. Because of that,\nwe are taking a moderately conservative stance on evolving the notebook\ndocument format. For us to create a new cell type, we would need to be\nconvinced that most of our users need it and that we can support it in a\nrobust way across all the different contexts that notebooks are used in\n(GitHub, nbviewer, live notebook, nbconvert, etc).\n\nYou are obviously free to create your own new notebook format using our\ncode (it is open source) and your own ideas+code.\n\nHowever, we will likely be a bit protective about the branding and\ntrademark aspects of this. Using the name \"Jupyter\" to describe a JSON\nnotebook format spec or document that doesn't follow our official JSON spec\nwould confuse users. Thus, we would ask developers building such things to\navoid using the name \"Jupyter\" to describe those documents or spec. Things\nlike the filename extension should also be different so tools that work\nwith notebooks will not confuse the different formats.\n\nCheers,\n\nBrian\n\nOn Sun, Oct 25, 2015 at 6:45 AM, Christophe BAL notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Is it possible to add other formatting language than Markdown ?
