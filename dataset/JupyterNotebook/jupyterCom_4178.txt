    "body": "Hi, I am nowhere near to the solution for this, but this what I have found so far:\r\n\r\n1. My own sphinx build does not even have the button tag (infact: it is not showing any html tag in the markdown), so it is just plain 'Run a code cell using `Shift-Enter` or pressing the button in the toolbar above'. When I try to add a `video` html tag with alternative text, only the alternative text appears.\r\n2. When I change the cell type from `Markdown` to `Raw NBConvert` then the icon will show and formatted correctly without the strange line break depicted.\r\n3. I tried using pandoc to convert it directly (instead of building from Sphinx) and the icon shows up (with and without using the switch `-f ipynb` (convert from ipynb)\r\n\r\nIs there any pointer of what can I try? Especially point 1 (how can I make the html tags appear with Sphinx?)",
