    "body": "I was just trying to hack something like this together.\nMy idea was a bit different. I try to use @damianavila  RISE plugin to create lecture notes. I would like to see code blocks within the notebook, but mark them \"hide\" during the presentation. Hence, I can easily read and follow what is done, but the presentation stays clean.\nI am trying to merge the hide plugin from @kirbs-  by adding a Boolean expression to the if-clause:\n\n```\nvar toggle_selected_input = function () {                                                                                                        \n        // Find the selected cell                                                                                                                    \n        var cell = Jupyter.notebook.get_selected_cell();                                                                                             \n        // Toggle visibility of the input div                                                                                    \n        if (cell.metadata.hide_input && $('#maintoolbar').hasClass('reveal_tagging'))  {                          \n            cell.element.find(\"div.input\").toggle('slow');                                                                                           \n        }                                                                                                                                            \n        cell.metadata.hide_input = ! cell.metadata.hide_input;                                                                                       \n    };                                                    \n```\n\nwhereas, $('#maintoolbar').hasClass('reveal_tagging')) is set by RISE to identify whether the presentation mode is on or off (as far as I understood).\n\nHowever, it seems that the above function as well as update_input_visibility is not called anymore after the switching to the presentation (which seems somehow logical). Thus, now I need to find the place to call update_input_visibility() after starting the presentation mode. What a pitty that this is my first contact with JS ;)\n\nEDIT: Just to get this again more on topic. Implementing this directly into Jupyter sounds great but please make sure, that different plugins or exports can easily utilise resp. customize the hide code functionality.\n",

    "body": "No problem; the package [pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/) is currently\nmy go to package for generating reports with python - though it's a long\nway off R's [KnitR](http://yihui.name/knitr/) in terms of functionality;\nhave a look at the pweave examples [here](http://mpastell.com/pweave/examples/) and KnitR examples [here](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples).\n\nThe philosophy is admittedly slightly different from a notebook - your goal\nfrom the start is to write code chronologically such that you 'Restart &\nRun All' at the end to generate your document. However, enabling this\nfunctionality could be quite simple: adding '[chunk](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) [options](http://mpastell.com/pweave/chunks.html)' to all code cells should allow\njupyter notebooks to be used for this purpose without any other changes.\n\nFrom my perspective, the reason why this style of working is important is\ntwofold:\n- Make creating reports easier\n  - no faffing with latex (though you can use latex within the document\n    when you want - already implemented in jupyter markdown cells)\n  - write the report as you code\n  - allow inline references to the data and results e.g. instead of\n    writing 'The mean of the column was 2.6' you would write 'The mean of the\n    column was `np.mean(some_array)`', such that, if and when your data\n    changes, you simply regenerate your report, safe in the knowledge the text\n    is still correct\n  - 1000s of researchers worldwide would benefit from the time saved\n- Make reports reproducible\n  - You know exactly what code you executed to create all the figures,\n    tables, and text\n  - Reproducibility in academic research is currently pretty poor -\n    creating tools to make this easier will have widespread benefits to the\n    academic community\n\nI think a good first step would be a markdown cell toolbar that controls\nsimple cell options like hiding (like the 'edit metadata' cell toolbar but\nhigher level). Most of the back end work appears to already be done - I\ndetail a solution [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31517194/how-to-hide-one-specific-cell-input-or-output-in-ipython-notebook/38040507#38040507)\nthat uses an nbextension - but an easy user interface that doesn't require\nfaffing with the cell metadata would be useful such that the user can see\nat a glance what to expect the generated report to look like.\n\nA more difficult next step, I imagine, would be thinking about how to\nimplement caching and whether that idea is compatible with the notebook\nphilosophy.\n\nI'm keen to contribute if I can so do let me know if I can help in some way.\n",
