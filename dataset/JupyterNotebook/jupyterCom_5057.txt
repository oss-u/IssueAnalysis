    "body": "Hi @stevehaertel.  This is a bizarre day as its the second occurrence (see #5055) of a gateway-related issue that should have been witnessed before and leads me to believe there's been some kind of change or something has side affected things such that these issues are now surfacing.  That said, I don't tend to have kernel issues or let culling occur very often, so perhaps this is just a humble reminder. :smile:\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, if I run with the updated file in #5055, I don't see this issue on my Notebook.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce your issue after a kernel has been culled (which may be a similar scenario in these failing cases you have).  After culling, the /api/sessions request, which ultimately hits the EG server to collect the running kernel models, fails but due to the error handling (fixed in #5055), causes the request from the browser to fail (I presume, I'm not a front-end person).  Since the directory listing always follows the /api/sessions request the contents request is not satisfied and, thus, the Files tab is empty.  Here are the two NB log entries from my system - when /api/sessions succeeds ...\r\n```\r\n[D 12:09:41.057 NotebookApp] 200 GET /api/sessions?_=1573848580376 (::1) 634.28ms\r\n[D 12:09:41.069 NotebookApp] 200 GET /api/contents/alice/YARN?type=directory&_=1573848580378 (::1) 6.42ms\r\n```\r\nI've gone ahead and attached a build from @shuichiro-makigaki's branch in hopes that you can take this for a spin in your configuration.  [notebook-7.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl.zip](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/files/3853034/notebook-7.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl.zip)\r\n\r\nBased on the output in your EG log, it looks like your kernels are failing to start in your Spark cluster.  I'd be happy to help with those issues in either the EG gitter channel or via an issue in the EG repo - if you like.",
