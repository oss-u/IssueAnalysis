The upload now started working. However, as per @cosmoscalibur , the config needs to be changed to `(desired size in MB * 1024 * 1024)` right? Then I wonder why 99.1 MB file wouldn't get uploaded if I mention the limit as `100 * 1024 * 1024` instead of `1000 * 1024 * 1024`?\r\n\r\n![sn3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45599762/107841068-a0542080-6ddd-11eb-96bb-99a2dd938234.png)\r\n\r\nThe size of file for your reference is as follows\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45599762/107841079-b4981d80-6ddd-11eb-9d8a-69d48b3680f9.png)\r\n",
