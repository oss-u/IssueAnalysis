I just spent a while trying to use the rate limiting command line options for jupyter, and  it doesn't seem to solve the real problem.   I can't think of any useful way to even use it, which is a bummer, since I desperately need something like this (as students are constantly causing trouble, which leads to disaster).  \n\nThe basic test problem is this:\n1. Drawing a plot should work.\n2. Doing something dumb like this should be severely limited: `for i in range(50000): print('hi')`.\n\nThe currently-implemented functionality treats the output of 1 and 2 exactly the same.  Both result in a single message.  However, rendering and dealing with a 0.3MB plot (say), is completely different than dealing with a single output message that is 0.3MB of strings of text, which is very hard on the browser to render...  Ignoring this difference is not good.\n\nIn SageMathCloud, images are just sha1 hashes that reference a remote image store.  So rate limiting based on data transmitted works fine. \n",

As it is now, we are getting a continuous stream of support requests due to people hitting even rather large rate limits.  E.g., here's one from 30 minutes ago: \"Hi, i am suddenly having trouble displaying a web map. Previously (3-4 weeks ago) it took a while to draw the map however it would display after a minute or two. Now i get an error when the \"display(m)\" function in cell 5 executes via the button press in cell 6. The error is as follows:  \"iopub data rate exceeded. The notebook server will temporarily stop sending iopub  messages to the client in order to avoid crashing it.  To change this limit, set the config variable  `--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit`.\"  \n\nThe error message provides no real help to my users.  They don't explicitly start Jupyter notebook servers -- they use Jupyter notebooks.  Instead, the error should be: \"iopub data rate exceeded. The notebook server will temporarily stop sending iopub  messages to the client in order to avoid crashing it.  To change this limit, ... run this code ...; for more help and options related to iopub rate limitation, type ... (or visit http://...)\"  \n\nAlso, this acknowledges that for _certain_ use cases having a high rate makes perfect sense!  E.g., there is a big difference between animations or interactive plotly usage... and just playing around learning the basics of Python.  Make it so the notebook creator can target these difference cases from the notebook itself, not from the server on the backend.  That's how SageMathCloud works.\n",

E.g., maybe\n\nYes and no. \n\nNo: The server act strictly as a proxy, it does not peek at the messages. \nYes: %blah could return a javascript object that would trigger some API call to the frontend.\nYes: You could inject a magic which is aware of the server and can communicate to it via another method.\n\nBut in the general case the kernel is in the dark as to whether the server is running it, or not. It could even be connected to 2 \"clients\" one that would be rate limited and not the other and would still be unaware of this fact.\n",
