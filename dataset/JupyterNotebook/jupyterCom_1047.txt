    "body": "This is ready!\n\n@Carreau this retains all of the require.js behavior, but as we start adding dependencies on true npm packages, it will make that more difficult.  I'm thinking about adding an index.js or change namespace.js so that it does and exposes imports to various useful modules.  Then, instead of telling people to \n\n``` js\ndefine(['path/to/module'], function(module) {\n})\n```\n\nwe would tell them to \n\n``` js\ndefine(function(require) {\nvar module = require('notebook')['path/to/module'];\n});\n```\n\nor  \n\n``` js\ndefine(function(require) {\nvar module = require('notebook')['modulename'];\n});\n```\n\n(in both cases notebook would be a require js config alias that pointed to a webpacked file somewhere)  \n\nThis way people have a way of importing the webpacked version of the module.\n",
