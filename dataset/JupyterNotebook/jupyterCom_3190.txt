For my situation, I had been using a Jupyter installation on 1 remote server, which I then migrated to another remote server (but more of a clean installation than a full migration).  For me, I was *still* accessing via the URL of \"http://localhost:9898\", but because that was the same as the old installation, my browser got all confused with the inconsistency of the cookies between the two.\r\n\r\nClearing my cookies for that domain and re-authorising has cleared all my issues for me.",
