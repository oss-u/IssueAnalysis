    "body": "Hi @web-sys1 - it appears that you configured `KernelManager.kernel_cmd` either as a command-line argument or via the configuration mechanisms and this is a duplicate of the issue you also just opened in [`jupyter_client`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/580).  Since `jupyter_client` is the correct location to work through this issue, I'm closing this here and we'll tackle this over in `jupyter_client`.  Thanks.",
