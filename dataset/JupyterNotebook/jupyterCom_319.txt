    "body": "So if an output contains an HTML import and that cell is run a 2nd time, it will try to do another HTML import and result in a fatal error? \r\n\r\nThe first solution that comes to mind is to create an extension and move the HTML imports and whatnot to it so that the HTML imports only happen on notebook load. This would also allow the web component(s) to be used across profiles and kernels. I've created a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter) for generating renderer extensions for both classic notebook and JupyterLab. This allows your extension to register a custom mime type (e.g. `application/vnd.compose3d+json`) so that your when the kernel returns output of that mime type (a Julia library can handle this part), your extension will be used to render it. It should be pretty straight-forward to setup: put the HTML imports in [`register_renderer`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.extension_name%7D%7D/nbextension/src/renderer.js#L54) and the rendering code in [`append_mime`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.extension_name%7D%7D/nbextension/src/renderer.js#L56-L69).",
