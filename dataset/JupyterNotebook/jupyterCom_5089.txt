    "body": "@Carreau, from a [related issue][5]:\r\n\r\n>  We could switch to 3.8 (non dev), 3.9-dev and nightly but I'm not sure it is worth it yet.\r\n\r\nI understand your caution.   I'm usually reserved on updates as well, and it's good practice.   \r\n\r\nFYI: Two cycles that may influence future jupyter-related tests on Python:\r\n\r\n1. [release][3] of the next conda distribution: appears to be 3-mo cycle, last one Oct-2019\r\n1. compressed annual release cycle ([PEP 602][0]): 1-year cycle\r\n\r\n(1) I suspect the next conda release will include 3.8.  I'm not sure, but I suppose jupyter would be aligned with that release.  (2) A shorter Python release adds impetus to test on latest Python sooner across all jupyter starting 3.9.  In response, here are related issues to the other Jupyter components.  \r\n\r\n- [ipykernel on 3.8][2]\r\n- [ipython on 3.8][5]\r\n\r\nI trust the team's discretion.  Many thanks on all you guys do.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [0]: https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-602-annual-release-cycle-for-python/2296\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5089\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/454\r\n  [3]: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/reference/release-notes/\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11974\r\n\r\n",
