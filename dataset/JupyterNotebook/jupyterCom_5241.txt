Since it looks like you may be using Anaconda, you might try this instead:\r\n```\r\nconda update -c conda-forge notebook\r\n``` \r\nIf you still run into issues upgrading, you might run as Administrator.\r\n\r\nOnce upgraded, and should you still encounter a permission issue when launching a notebook (the message will be slightly different and will reference `jupyter_core` instead of `jupyter_client`), you might take a look here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5197#issuecomment-587063740",
