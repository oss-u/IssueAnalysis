Then the Markdown is rendered, and the math parts put back into the HTML so that Mathjax can run on them.\r\n\r\nI would guess that something in that process of separating out the math parts from the markdown parts is going awry. It's designed to recognise `\\begin{foo}` and `\\end{foo}` tags as well as `$$`.",
