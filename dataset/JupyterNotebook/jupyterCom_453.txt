    "body": "> If that's too much clutter, maybe just making Sublime the default.\n\nThe problem is not that much the clutter but the slippery slope, if you add a UI element people assume it will switch live, which is more implementation, also you need to implement a dynamic module loading for keymap which is probably an afternoon of work + roughly 1h/week of support for questions and bug report. \n\nBut then why only keymap ? Why not indentUnits ? Indent with tabs instead of space ? visible tabs as now you want to know if you use tab ? if you have visible tabs, user request all visible characters to have a visible representation. \n\nOnly  looking at codemirror without plugin you get 20 configuration options which don't have more reason to not have an UI than another. Potentially with options that might differ in between code cell, and markdown cell. \n\nThat's only looking at codemirror. You can add notebook theme, folding/scrolling of output area, buttons in toolbar, etc...\n\nSo the line we define for now is: \"if you want to configure, you have to go through extension or write JSON/js by hand\". It is not definitive and if/when we have more manpower and people actually willing to write **and maintain** a genearal configuration panel we can reconsider. \n\nFor the time cost/benefit  ratio lean toward not doing it. \n",
