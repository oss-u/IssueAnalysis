    "body": "> Amazing ... 6 months after I asked a simple question, the issue is closed without even attempting to address the original problem or to enter into any dialog at all about it.\n\nSorry about that, the \"close and comment button\" is next to the \"comment\" one, it's common to miss click on the wrong button, especially when navigating quickly with the keyboard. So annoying that there are even [extensions to move it](https://userstyles.org/styles/106116/move-the-close-button-on-github-com).\n\nIt's true also that we are small team, and literally have 100ds of notification each day – just today ~50 issues open, many notification per issue just on GitHub. Though we try our best and we like to have the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe comment that \"without even attempting to address the original problem or to enter into any dialog at all about it.\" seem a bit harsh, as 2 developers from the team did write comment explaining the current situation: and proposing to write an extension.\n\nAnyway looking again at the issue and the already given comments: yes it is an issue we are aware of; we need to have incremental saving/synchronization. Which is not going to happen that soon but is worked on. And like the second, I agree that a configuration option is likely not the right way to tackle, it but that yes, a custom extension for the notebook can perfectly handle the case and strip bokeh plot at save time. \n\nWe are likely not going to special case Bokeh, and I know of a few people that will purchase us to the end of the earth with chainsaw if we strip large output by default.\n\nSo here is the status quo. there is likely nothing that going to be done for this specific case right now, at least not in core. And it will improve with time. \n`custom.js` and various extensions can achieve that, if needed, but we don't provide stable API for it. \nSo your best chance is to go with a custom API, resources online are plentiful, if you need a hand we'll be happy to provide more information. \n\nThanks, \n",

I didn't know anything about extensions or even that they existed.\nI also wasn't trying to fix a special case with Bokeh. The problem exists where any cell output in large quantity is produced.\n\nOK, I will search for the online resources about extensions and see how that works. A requirement to work remotely will undoubtedly appear again soon, so it would be nice to be ready.\n\nThanks,\n",
