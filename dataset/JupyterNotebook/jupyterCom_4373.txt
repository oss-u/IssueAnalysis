    "body": "Hmm - that's a good question.  I'm not sure its possible to go \"console to notebook\" since the notebook's kernel manager won't have a record of the kernel.  Since jupyter_console is much more direct, it just needs the connection file.  But notebook has a much longer path to that area and I'm fairly certain there's no way to convey that \"I'm connecting to an existing kernel and here's its connection information\" like `--existing` does in jupyter console.\r\n\r\nHowever, this appears to be possible using Jupyter Lab.  If I start a console, do some work, then open a notebook.  I get prompted for the kernel to use.  I can then scroll down to \"Use kernel from other sessions\" and associate a notebook to the kernel launched as a console.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22599560/75181826-ee1ad900-56f3-11ea-8604-de9c21990d6a.png)\r\n\r\nGiven that Lab is built on the notebook server, this must be possible via Notebook, but it's probably the case that Lab is managing details regarding the actual steps taken via the REST API, etc.\r\n\r\n@jasongrout and @blink1073 may have some insights for how to do this via Notebook classic.\r\n",
