    "body": "I was going to pick \"G\" for \"group\".\n\nI don't think that user tests will be able to tell the difference between\nthe options we are looking at (WETG). A carefully designed user test could\npossible tell the difference between no shortcut for this and a shortcut. I\nam willing to think about how we can do that test with some external folks,\nbut I would want to delay 4.1 for that. A simpler approach is to do what we\ndid with the ctrl-space - commit a new possibility to master and have us\nall try it out during the beta process.\n\nIt is really important that when we release new features, they don't have\nusability problems from the start. We can't afford to accumulate design or\nusability debt. I realize that I don't represent all users, but I have\n_only_ used the new cell selection with the ctrl-space shortcut. That\nevidence is strong enough for me that I feel we need to at least make a\nstrong attempt to try and figure this out for 4.1.\n\nI also think there is a space in between formal usability testing and\n\"guesswork.\" We have mostly built our current UI by trying things out\nourselves and seeing if we can find behaviors we all agree work well. Let's\ntry to do that _first_ before declaring failure.\n\n[as an aside, this is further evidence that we shouldn't mix new features\nthat involve usability/design in bug fixes releases - it is slow work]\n\nCheers,\n\nBrian\n\nOn Tue, Nov 3, 2015 at 9:06 PM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> What shortcut did you choose? why ?\n> \n> Keep in mind that people can still:\n> - mark multiple contiguous cell with keyboard,\n> - unmark with keyboard\n> - mark non-contiguous with mouse.\n> - unmark non-contiguous with mouse.\n> \n> I don't see why this would be more important than:\n> click-first, Shift-click last : mark a range.\n> \n> And I would _really_ prefer not to get a wrong shortcut for 4.1, and test\n> the water with usability test, than to guesswork.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/703#issuecomment-153547759.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
