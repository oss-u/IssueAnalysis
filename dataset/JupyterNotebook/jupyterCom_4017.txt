    "body": "The big counterargument here is that many users don't *need* to set a password. If you're using the notebook locally in one browser, you can always be automatically authenticated. I've never set a password for my notebook servers, for instance.\r\n\r\nRandomly generated tokens are more secure than memorable passwords. If we force people to set a password when it seems unnecessary, they're very likely to reuse a password they already use elsewhere. That both weakens the security of their notebook (elsewhere might get hacked), and makes Jupyter a more attractive target for hackers trying to steal credentials.",
