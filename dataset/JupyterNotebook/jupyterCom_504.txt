    "body": "@tleeuwenburg The Hub most certainly does not need to run as root in general, and you can definitely do what you are asking for right now, without any extension of JuptyerHub at all. The _default_ configuration is the simplest, where it needs access to the PAM service and using setuid to switch users. But the design of JupyterHub is focused on making it easy to have custom Authenticators (handle authentication) and Spawners (spawning servers for users). Existing custom Authenticators include using GitHub OAuth, Bitbucket, CILogon, Google OAuth, a simple dictionary, etc. And it's pretty common to use docker to spawn user servers, but you can also use PBS or any other mechanism.\n",
