    "body": "Hi @raj9650sahni - I think you're experiencing an issue similar to [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5235#issuecomment-587545067) and revisiting the installation of `pywin32` is probably warranted.\r\n\r\nI had a couple of other observations:\r\n- Your python installation location is a little odd, although should be fine.  Not sure if you want to revisit that as well.\r\n- There are references to python 2.7 - which has past end-of-life - so you might want to update those applications.  They appear related to jupyter packages.\r\n- I took the liberty to update the title of this issue since that appears to be meant for a comment somewhere else.",
