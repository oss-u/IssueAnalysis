There was a change to how we set the DPI, which should work better, but I believe you need IPython ≥ 5.4 and ipykernel ≥ 4.5 for it to fully work right, where `fig.dpi` takes precedence over `rc['savefig.dpi']`. In particular, I seem to recall there being a regression if only one of those has been upgraded but not the other, but I don't recall the details.\r\n\r\ncf https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/pull/176 https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/9868",
