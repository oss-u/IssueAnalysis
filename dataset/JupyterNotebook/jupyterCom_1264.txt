    "body": "This is something have have played with. In general we have found that most\nexplicit scrolling events end up causing unpleasant side effects that are\nworse than the original problem.\n\nIn this case, the input area of cells can have arbitrary length - it very\nmay be that the scroll cell to top action could scroll the output off the\nscreen. To get this to work well, we would need some more specific logic\nthat uses heuristics to try and make good decisions. I am not convinced\nthose heuristics would work well, but if you are able to make progress, let\nus know.\n\nOn Fri, Mar 25, 2016 at 1:18 PM, gyphub notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Once a cell is run, you naturally want to see the output.
