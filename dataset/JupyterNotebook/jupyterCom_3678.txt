    "body": "As usual, this is one of the competing use case things. I added this because for service-style deployments like Binder / Docker / etc., it makes more sense for services to log all access, but I recognize that it adds noise to scroll past in the local-user case if you need to recover the token again after having used it for a while. I don't love adding more configuration options, but maybe we should have a 'log_requests' flag that's off by default?\r\n\r\n> How can we make it clear to people who might be capturing logs that it contains sensitive information unless you turn that off?\r\n\r\nGood question. We only log the token for the cases where the token is auto-generated and thus required to put somewhere to communicate it to users. If a token or password is *specified*, then nothing is logged. We could add to the log itself that this message will not be displayed if a token/password is set via config. What do you think?",
