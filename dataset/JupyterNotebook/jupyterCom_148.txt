I've had some very long-running processes that generated graphs that could then be referenced through several iterations of restarting the kernel after other long-running computations had to be killed.  If I accidentally forgot that running a new cell would clear my output, and had to wait a few hours for a graph to be generated again, that would be a huge annoyance.  That's certainly an argument for me being smarter about saving my work, but automatically clearing output can cause a lot of frustration in general.\n\nI do, however, like the idea of somehow obviously marking cells that were generated by \"old\" kernels, to reduce the confusion @takluyver mentioned.\n\nThe button / menu item approach seems ideal to me.\n",
