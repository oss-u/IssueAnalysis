My code returns complete HTML5 documents which can contain svg graphics, embedded tables and any other html elements. It contains css already too.

Curiously, displaying wide dataframes still has the scrollbar and the column headers aren't overlapped.\r\n\r\nHere's a picture of the problem. I also have a customer who see data values overlap too. This case just happens to be the column names. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17710182/37100463-012195be-21f1-11e8-8eec-0ec049e6cf0d.png)\r\n\r\nIs there any kind of a fix for this or a work around I can implement in my code?
