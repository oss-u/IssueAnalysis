    "body": "Hey Carreau. I noticed on the google forum you said the code would need a significant refactor, and MinRK said it involved storing outputs on the server. In my case I'm ok with losing the outputs during the disconnect. I just need to be able to reconnect the browser session to the kernel to get new outputs and to get at the data and code I've loaded. Kernel/Reconnect doesn't do it. I've also tried closing the tab and opening a new one from the Jupyter base page.\n\nThis is fairly important for me. I live in a rural area with a poor internet connection and my notebook takes about 8 hours to load. I'm pretty well guaranteed to have an interruption during that time. \n",

    "body": "Hi friends,\r\n\r\nI have this problem often, when the output buffer stops (I use Atom/Hydrogen), and I lose visibility of long running processes. \r\n\r\nI have found a bit of a workaround which may be helpful to others (but it requires this to be done upfront, i.e. there is no way that I have found to resume output from existing processes).\r\n\r\nThe solution requires SSH access, and involves redirecting [logging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41507783/writing-scikit-learn-verbose-log-into-an-external-file) to a file as follows:\r\n```\r\n    import sys\r\n    log_file = 'results.log'\r\n    sys.stdout=(open(log_file,\"w\"))\r\n    clf = RandomizedSearchCV(RandomForestRegressor(random_state = 0), param_distributions = param_grid, n_iter = 200, cv=3, random_state = 42, verbose = 51, n_jobs=8)\r\n    sys.stdout.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy example is arbitrarily for a RandomizedSearchCV.\r\n\r\nHowever, buffering in std.out proved to be an issue, so [Magnus Lycka's referenced answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107705/disable-output-buffering) proved helpful in overriding this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Unbuffered(object):\r\n   def __init__(self, stream):\r\n       self.stream = stream\r\n   def write(self, data):\r\n       self.stream.write(data)\r\n       self.stream.flush()\r\n   def writelines(self, datas):\r\n       self.stream.writelines(datas)\r\n       self.stream.flush()\r\n   def __getattr__(self, attr):\r\n       return getattr(self.stream, attr) \r\n```\r\n\r\nand replace above sys.stdout=(open(log_file,\"w\")) with:     \r\n`sys.stdout=Unbuffered(open(log_file,\"w\"))`\r\n\r\nNow, you can ssh into the machine, run `docker exec -it image_name bash` and `tail -f` the log file.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, it seems to be the best solution for now.",
