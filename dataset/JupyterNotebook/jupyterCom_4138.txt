    "body": "Hi --  I am experiencing a similar problem.  I have the same remapping and it used to work, but stopped at some point.  I have not upgraded to Mojave, and my best estimate is that the issue started late summer 2018.  I only use chrome, but also see the issue in Safari and Firefox.  I have noticed this problem (instead of respecting the remapping for paste, ctrl-v performs a emacs like cursor movement)  with Jupyter notebooks, and also when editing a gist on github.  I do not have problem in other apps such as gmail.  \r\n\r\nMy guess is that this not related to  Chrome or the OS, but maybe to a change in codemirror, or whatever js component is being used for code editing by Jupyter/Github.  \r\n\r\nIf the Jupyter dev's have any thoughts or pointers or temporary workarounds that would help trace this or request a change to the appropriate upstream that would be great.   \r\n\r\nthanks!",

    "body": "It worked! Mac OS 10.15.5, tested not in jupyter but in Firefox, but the issue is definitely the same\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Create `StandardKeyBinding.dict` like @tolland suggest, but do not use Finder or default text editor - use terminal (e.g. `touch` + `vi`/`nano`)\r\n\r\nFirst, it didn't work for me as well and the problem appears to be in Finder or default text editor of Mac OS: when I was creating a file I was using Finder (xtraFinder) to create a text file. It was created with `.txt` extension that I deleted and edited the file with the default text editor - added\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"^v\" = \"noop:\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand restart the computer\r\n\r\nAnd nothing happened :(\r\n\r\nThen I go in Finder to the file - it was good. !BUT! When I go to the folder in terminal and do `ls` it showed that file has `.txt` extension!\r\n\r\nSo the right way to go is to create a file and content through the terminal (e.g. touch + nano), restart the computer and enjoy the results :)",
