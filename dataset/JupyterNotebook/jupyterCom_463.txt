    "body": "There isn't a 'detach' mechanism per se, since the document state is computed in the browser, so without a browser the transform of messages to document won't happen. We do plan to come up with a way to move document state to the server-side, which would alleviate this. For now, there are two ways that you can do an offline run of a notebook, however:\n1. use `jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook MYNOTEBOOK`, which opens the notebook and runs it with a kernel, storing the output in a new notebook (add `--inplace` to overwrite the existing notebook instead of making a copy with the results). This isn't a perfect mirror of the in-browser run if there are javascript outputs or widgets that do certain things, but for more static outputs it should work fine.\n2. script with a browser emulator, such as phantomjs. I don't have an example for such a script, but it would better match the experience of running a notebook in a real browser.\n",
