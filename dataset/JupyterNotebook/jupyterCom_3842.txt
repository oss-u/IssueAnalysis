Since this is not indicated to the user, the default assumption of users might be that password-setting does not work at all:\r\n\r\n1. Set password on freshly installed server with token\r\n2. login works ok (only once!)\r\n3. Go to remote computer: login fails.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is inconsistent, because the first login with password-setting and token seems to have worked fine. It just works once until the server is restarted.\r\n\r\nSince this might lead to users disabling authentication, this bug is security relevant. At the very least, it should be signalled to the user that a restart of the server is required, if a user changed the password...",
