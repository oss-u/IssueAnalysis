I believe notebook.js would impact a notebook specifically. \r\n2. Once you make your js edits, you need to build the js. (npm run build)\r\n\r\nThe last step creates a new min.js file, which is then loaded into the browser. It is bundled from all of the js files the view depends on! This is why when you changed main.min.js, it worked. \r\n\r\n",
