    "body": "Thanks, this is looking good. A couple of things:\r\n\r\n- Could we ask you to do this with your editor configured not to strip trailing spaces? If you look at [the changes](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3511/files), you'll see that >100 lines are changed because of automatically removed whitespace. This can cause unnecessary merge conflicts, and it makes `git blame` less useful.\r\n- Having two buttons seems redundant; the user doesn't really have two options. Maybe get rid of the 'OK' button in this case?\r\n- I think it would be good for the message to mention that Jupyter needs cookies to work. Also, if we can find a good website explaining what cookies are and how to make sure they're enabled on different browsers, we could link to it.",
