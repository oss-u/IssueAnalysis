We've sometimes seen problems with security software interfering with our connections.\r\n\r\nThe sockets use ZeroMQ as a communications layer, and I think there's some kind of handshake involved. Maybe that is being delayed somehow. To test this theory, run:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport zmq\r\nctx = zmq.Context.instance()\r\nsock = ctx.socket(zmq.DEALER)\r\nsock.connect(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:12345\") # Use the port for the shell or control socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeyond that, @minrk is the ZMQ expert.",

    "body": "I have no security software besides windows defender installed. Unfortunately, this is a work PC, so I can't fully turn it off. I did add a rule that allowed all connections both incoming and outgoing, and still saw the same effect. Besides, if the security software were the issue, I'd expect that the connection would be fully blocked, and nothing would work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had to get this up and running quickly, so I had to resort to the nuclear option: I did a system restore from a few days ago. Looking through the windows update history and the affected drivers, the only thing that seemed to be installed was a security update for SQL server ([KB4058560](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4058560/security-update-for-vulnerabilities-in-sql-server)), which was reverted during the system restore. After the restore, everything seems to be functioning as expected. It doesn't make sense to me that an update for SQL server would interfere with jupyter, but that's the only thing that seems to have changed. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nSo, although I don't have a great answer as to why this happened, there's nothing really more to do at the moment. I'll close this issue. If this crops up again, I'll try the code you suggested. Thanks for the prompt response!",
