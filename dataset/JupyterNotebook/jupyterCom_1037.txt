If you wanted local mathjax, you could install it as an nbextension. This no longer has any effect as of notebook 4.0, because we bundle MathJax as a plain old dependency.\n\nThe only relevant one if you are using current versions is 3, now that the notebook bundles a stripped MathJax as a normal dependency.\n",

    "body": "> Assuming that I'm adamant about MathML, how would I ensure that the required files are accessible to the frontend?\n\nYou would need to modify the notebook's build process to change what files are installed, then run `python setup.py install`. [This is where we whitelist MathJax files](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/4.0.0/setupbase.py#L150).\n\nSince we do the slimming at install time, instead of the above, you will have all of MathJax available if you do a development install:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jupyter/notebook\ncd notebook\npython setup.py js css\npip install -e .\n```\n\nwhich only links to the source dir, instead of copying the whitelisted files into site-packages.\n\n> Why a stripped copy of MathJax?\n\nSize. A complete MathJax install is many times larger than the entirety of the notebook and all other dependencies combined. A slimmed version without image fonts is still more than everything else combined. So we follow the recommended MathJax process for stripping the size of an install by only including the files/fonts we use at install time.\n\nWe could add MathML as an additional bundled output format, since it is not especially large.\n",

Restarting Jupyter, restarting the system, did not help. What was going on?\n\n> We could add MathML as an additional bundled output format, since it is not especially large.\n\nThat would be great. Not all of us live and die by Google's mandates (re: chrome's removal of MathML).\n\n> Size. A complete MathJax install is many times larger than the entirety of the notebook and all other dependencies combined.\n\nOk I understand the point about disproportionate size, but for context : the anaconda installer alone is 330MB. Any number of MathJax files of any size is not going to affect me in any way. And I think such users would form a significant chunk of Jupyter's userbase.\n\nI hope you guys can point me to the reason (github issue/commit) why IPython3/Jupyter moved to a bundled copy of MathJax from a package/nbextension... And would it be possible for me to redirect Jupyter to use a full, separately installed copy of MathJax? I am guessing that I could install a copy of MathJax, and then change some paths in Jupyter.\n",
