    "body": "Hello @lresende, concretely I launch a Jupyter Notebook on any remote machine, the displayed link is not working. Because the hostname is displayed, that is not a valid domain name (locally it works because the `hosts` file gives the hostname as an alias name to localhost, 127.0.0.1 or ::1 to do the DNS resolution). For example, I get 'server01' instead of 'server01.example.com'.\r\n\r\nFor the users that run Jupyter Notebook locally, some ones have configured their fqdn (it works), but a lambda user doesn't have configured that, it works again (because socket.getfqdn() shows their hostname, in this case no change for them).

The code would then become...\r\n```python\r\nif self.ip in ('', '0.0.0.0'):\r\n     ip = \"%s\" % (socket.getfqdn() if self.use_fqdn else socket.gethostname())\r\n```\r\nYour users could either set `--use-fqdn` when launching notebook/lab or configure `c.NotebookApp.use_fqdn = True`",
