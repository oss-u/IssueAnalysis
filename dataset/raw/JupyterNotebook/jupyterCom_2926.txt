    "body": "Thanks, that's a pointer that we're doing something we shouldn't be in IPython. ipython/ipython#10859 ought to fix it.\r\n\r\nPackages can provide plugins for the pygments syntax highlighter to offer extra highlighting styles (among other things). It appears voltron provides a pygments style plugin. IPython uses pygments, and for a help string it tries to get a list of the available styles, which causes pygments to load them all. In your case, there's a problem with the style from voltron, so you see an error. But this is also a bad idea generally, because finding and loading plugins can be quite slow.",
