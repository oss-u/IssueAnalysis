    "body": "Thank you for the `pip freeze` and `kernel.json` information.  However, the most important information is that of the command window output.  By 'command window', I am not referring to the output you see in the web browser.  That had already been provided and I don't expect new information displayed there.  However, the window in which you typed `jupyter notebook --debug` to start the Notebook server in the first place is where the interesting output will be.\r\n\r\nI don't know the Windows integration well enough for how people launch Notebook servers.  On the Windows machine I have access to, I start a CMD \"shell\", then type `jupyter notebook --debug`.  This produces information such as the URL to use from the browser to access the server, etc.  It's this \"shell\" in which important details regarding the lifecycle of your failing kernel will reside.  Based on your screenshot, this may be the window associated with the Anaconda icon, I don't know.\r\n\r\nThat said, and groping in the dark here, it looks like you're using some older versions of jupyter modules that have been updated with important fixes that apply to Windows platforms.  As a result, I recommend you do the following...\r\n\r\n1. Stop the Notebook server.  You'll need to figure out where that occurs from.  Typically, this operation will consist of hitting <ctrl-C> twice in the command window in which the server was started.\r\n2. Upgrade your Notebook using: `conda update -c conda-forge notebook` from the appropriate conda env.  Once completed, ensure that `jupyter_client` and `jupyter_core` have versions `5.3.4` and `4.6.1`, respectively.\r\n3. Restart your Notebook server with `--debug` and try running the kernel again.\r\n\r\nShould the failure continue, you're going to need to figure out how to provide the output of the command window in which the Notebook server (not the web page) was started.\r\n\r\nIf others more familiar with the various Windows env interactions that myself can help determine where the Notebook's stdout and stderr are going here, please chime in.  \r\n\r\nThanks.",
