    "body": "There is inherent ambiguity in this command-line, since `--no-browser` means \"don't launch the browser\" but `jupyter notebook .../bqplot.ipynb` explicitly means \"launch the browser with bqplot.ipynb open.\" The current behavior I think is based on the fact that `c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False` is more likely to be permanent configuration in a config file (fairly common configuration, I think), while `file_to_run` always comes from the command-line.\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter notebook ~/src/QuantStack/voila/notebooks --no-browser\r\n```\r\n\r\nhas precisely the desired effect (set the notebook directory, but don't open a particular file), right? But the current behavior is harder to achieve with this change (don't open browser by default, but still easy to open a single file when desired). Is there something in voila that changes the interpretation of file_to_run to make these assumptions different? If so, it may make sense for it to be a deviation from the classic notebook server.",
