    "body": "Right, as a general principle, it is NEVER SAFE to run a public (as in the\nwhole world) notebook server. JupyterHub, as documented in\nhttps://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io\n<https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> is the minimum\nacceptable protection for remote-code-execution-as-a-service. It expects\nkubernetes, either on an in-house cluster, or from a commodity cloud vendor.\n\nIf you PERSONALLY KNOW the people that use the server, e.g. your coworkers\nor research group, AND it is behind SSL (or better still a VPN) it CAN be\nokay to run https://tljh.jupyter.org. It can be used on your own (modern\ndebian) server, Digital Ocean, and other low-cost hosts.\n\nAs an absolute last resort, for example if all of the users already have\nshell access over SSH on the server, it can be fine to run notebook, but\neven then you would want each of them to run their own notebook server\nprocess, as the notebook server is not intended to be used by multiple\nusers.\n\nIf you just want to render notebooks, you can also run a local instance of\nnbviewer.org, but even then you need to be careful.\n\nOn Sun, Sep 29, 2019 at 11:55 AM Kerwin Sun <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi @huwenfeng <https://github.com/huwenfeng> , maybe you can have a look\n> about jupyterhub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>.\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4920?email_source=notifications&email_token=AAALCRF2ZU3W4SDKHOERNLDQMDFWRA5CNFSM4I3RCVSKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOD73YKHQ#issuecomment-536315166>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAALCRFUN7YQYEZ5T422ZJLQMDFWRANCNFSM4I3RCVSA>\n> .\n>\n",
