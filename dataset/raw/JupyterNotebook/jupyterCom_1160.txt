    "body": "Note that currently it doesn't even execute or edit notebooks. So the main functionality of the notebook doesn't actually work _at all_. It's ok to push out alpha tools, but the current state isn't quite at alpha functionality yet, and we run the risk of simply turn users away.\n\nI think we need to introduce it _gradually_. As we gain more functionality, we can display it more prominently, but right now we basically need design/UI feedback, it's not really something people can \"try\" in the sense of using it as a notebook, even for 5 minutes.\n\nSo I think we need:\n-  initially a less-prominent invitation, just so it's easy to find it for someone who actually wants to help test.  We can email the list for now to invite people to try it out.  @takluyver's suggestion is a good one. To keep it simple, we could make it  a plain text link for now (to avoid re-design work); once it matures we can use the nice \"try me\" button.\n- an information page that tells people roughly what to expect.  Right now, they might assume that it's an actual notebook, and think the lack of execution (a most basic feature to do anything useful) is missing might be a bug.  We don't want that reported, so people need to know what's to be expected as working and what they should report as a bug.\n- as we add features, we can move the invitation to be more prominent, changing the plain text link to be the nicer button at the top.\n\nAnd yes, I'm a developer (sort of :) who runs off master and tried it, but I was immediately confused by the lack of execution, which I thought was a bug as I would expect that it would at least let me do _something_ with the notebooks.  So if _I_ had that reaction, we should assume that it can happen to others too and act accordingly.\n",

The Lab Page is not the only one that get update and need feedback and have no reason to get special treatment. Plus it attracts all users that are running on master instead of just advanced developer who are the one we seek feedback from. \n\nThe master branch is also useful to see how people discover things in the UI, and if the interaction with the UI is seamless and feature discoverable.\n\nAdding a flashy button which main point is to be removed later,  have a complete opposite effect of what is desired,  and target the wrong kind of individual thus makes no sens to me. \n",
