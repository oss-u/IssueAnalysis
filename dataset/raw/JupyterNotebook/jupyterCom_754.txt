The other thing is that I\ndon't think we should cover basic git and github usage in the guide. It\nshould suffice to describe _how_ we use git/GitHub (pull requests, rebasing\nnot merging) and then link to other content that gives the full details of\nhow to use git/Github.

The mere act of writing these guides will show us where our on-ramp to contribution is more like a fence with barbed wire :(\n\nAgreed that for more generic things about github workflows we can just link, but in general I think the pandas guide is an excellent starting point: it is comprehensive, and systematic.\n\nAs far as our docs, the beauty is that as usual, it's a mess :) Our real developer documentation isn't linked from the page that Brian mentioned above, that only talks about contributing to the docs. All our developer-oriented docs are still in the [old IPython docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/development/index.html), and the information about contributing to the project itself is [in the wiki](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-Index).\n\nAs a starting point, cleaning up that mess with a first pass of rationalizing the information would be already huge progress and would make things more welcoming to newcomers.\n\nPinging @minrk who's also been thinking about this...\n",
