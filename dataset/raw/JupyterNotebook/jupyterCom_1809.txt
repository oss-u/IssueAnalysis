And need APIs to pass the commit message around. \n\nFirst this need to have some conflicting in a couple of files:\n\n```\nnotebook/static/notebook/js/menubar.js\nnotebook/templates/page.html\n```\n\nSecond as a advice I would suggest you configure your editor to not autostrip trialing whitespace, it increases the chances of conflict, and screw up git history (in particular blam which is useful). \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask !\n",
