Here are some security documents about configuring the the server and notebook for security in a production environment:\n- [Notebook Server Security](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/public_server.html#notebook-server-security)\n- [Security in Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html)\n- [Running a Public notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/public_server.html#running-a-public-notebook-server)\n\nI hope you will find these helpful in illustrating the project's commitment to security importance and flexibility for users facing a variety of situations from closed trusted networks to a public deployment.\n\nThanks!\nCarol\n\ncc/ @minrk @rgbkrk \n",
