    "body": "- Regarding the argument about ambiguity, IMO there will always be this kind of ambiguity:\n  - when you only see the end of a code cell on your screen, is it a very long cell or am I just missing a line?\n  - in your implementation of styling, if you only display the last two cells: am I seeing the whole selection or are there 3 or more cells selected.\n  \n  In that regard, the one-cell selection is not special and should probably not be treated in a different fashion.\n- Why make selections of length one a special case?\n  - I would \"invoke\" the Zen of Python: _Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules._\n  - Having a visual change between the case of a selection of length one or more gives the wrong impression that there is a modal thing going on, while it is not the case, which is confusing by the user.\n- Regarding the fact that the head of the selection is styled differently than the rest of the selection:\n  - I picked the example of Excel to show that people are used to seeing one privileged cell in their selection styled differently. Hence I think that it is \"OK\" to do so. Microsoft must have done endless UX experiments in that regard, and the fact that they adopted it means that it is _not_ confusing.\n- Excel handles the styling of the last selected cells when there is an heterogeneous selection (with Crtl+Click) because in that case, there _is_ an ambiguity, in that you don't see if there are other cells selected. (See below and compare to the top screenshot)\n  <img width=\"270\" alt=\"heterogeneous\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2397974/13231049/f0cb7a4c-d975-11e5-8811-38486f53bd2f.png\">\n",

    "body": "The difference is that some action **do behave differently in multiple selection**. \nMerge is one example. So there **is** a modal difference. \n\nIf you take microsoft example, the head is style differently with multiple select (IIUC) when it's blue and have a special corner, while it's white with only 1 cell selected. \nSo just the visual appearance of the head allow to distinguish.\nThe Style change you propose does not allow such a difference.\n\nI think it also make it much harder to convey some ideas. In your screenshot of excel the selection has a nice border, which make it obvious \"what is selected\". While our border is only around that head. \n\nSo I think that in your proposal the white background+border make a too huge difference. We can though refine for 5.0, but changing now after many weeks on the old style is too risky. \n",

The selection state can. \nWe already have a highly confusing UI for beginners, and when giving talks, there is no reason to make the UI more confusing in one specific case. \n\nI just show a case where you cannot distinguish, so I just give one argument against this case. \nShow me a case where your UI is better, and then we can discuss wether it's worth. \n\nBut right now the curent state only have drawbacks for users. \n",

The one-cell case is not special IMO.\n",
