    "body": "I have run into the same issue, and when I check the jupyter kernelspec it shows the proper kernel(s). I'm guessing the problem is not in Jupyter but actually with the Anaconda install/uninstall. It appears that because they do not clean paths/registry keys properly, uninstalling and reinstalling Anaconda breaks Jupyter notebooks. I've been trying to track down why this happens, and so far I'm coming up empty. I opened an issue at Anaconda for this same problem: [https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1458](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1458)\r\n\r\nThe good news is, if the problems is the same as the one that I'm having, you should be able to use Python without Jupyter Notebook. I use Spyder just fine without any problems. I found that it was actually a good think for my coding to create codes outside of Notebooks, some bad practices had crept in after using Notebook too long. ",
