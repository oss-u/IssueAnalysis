This PR makes the docs current for the end user while we troubleshoot why RTD was failing for the past month to build the docs correctly. \n\nI think that nbgrader has a good model for how to build the rst files. My recommendation would be to refactor the docs here to use that model. This PR just brings the docs to being current in the interim.\n",
