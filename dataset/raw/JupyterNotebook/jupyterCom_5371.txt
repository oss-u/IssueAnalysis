I suspect something is amiss with the `argv` stanza of your kernel's `kernel.json` file.\r\n\r\nPlease run `jupyter kernelspec list` and identify the kernel you're using.  Go to the corresponding directory and verify if the first element of the `argv` array is valid and adjust accordingly.  This is most likely the path to `python` and the value might not be correct for the Windows platform.  If it shows python in the `bin` directory and it isn't in your `bin` directory or has a `.exe` extension update that argument.  On Windows you might find `python` located in the sibling `Scripts` directory.",

If entirely different, was the actual value from a previous env or something like that?  That is, once you saw the value, things started making sense due to other changes in the configuration?\r\n\r\nJust hoping this extra level of detail may help others solve related issues.  Thank you.",
