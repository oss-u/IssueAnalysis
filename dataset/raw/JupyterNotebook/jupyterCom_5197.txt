    "body": "Understood.  Yes, this is an issue with the server and you might need to enlist the help of a colleague, if available.  The issue is that the mounted filesystem, used by WSL, is currently configured to set all file permission bits on files.  The file that is being created when a kernel (notebook) is launched is considered secure (because it contains connection information) and the Jupyter code is trying to protect the file, but can't due to the filesystem behavior.  \r\n\r\nI believe there are two forms of work around here...\r\n\r\n1. You can point your Jupyter runtime directory to a different location by setting `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR` to a different location that doesn't reside in the filesystem.  However, I'm not familiar enough with Windows and WSL to know the best approach for that.\r\n2. You can upgrade `juptyer_core` to its recent `4.6.2` release (`pip install jupyter_core --upgrade`), then set environment variable `JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES=True`.  This should only be done with your consent because it will allow the insecure file to persist for the duration of the notebook kernel.\r\n\r\nIn either case, some level of server-side operations are required, so you might need to enlist the help of someone familiar with these kinds of operations.",

Case matters for the variable name, but not for the value.  To confirm the environment variable is in place, enter `$env:JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES` (per the blog post) in a new command shell and ensure it displays the appropriate value.\r\n\r\nOnce the variable is in place, restart notebook from a command window that has the environment variable.
