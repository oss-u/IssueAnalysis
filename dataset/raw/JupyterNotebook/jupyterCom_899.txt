    "body": "> Pr #882 removed config_dir kwarg as it was ignored.\n\nIt was remove primarily because it was \"forcing\" the `config_dir` at the notebookapp level...\n\n> Though, #893 argues that we might need it and that it will be complex to\n> reintroduce it.\n\nWe don't need the `config_dir` option at the ConfigManager class, we just need to avoid the enforcement at the notebookapp level. I guess nobody was using the ConfigManager.config_dir option before because it was not working... but we don't need that option\n\nMy believe is that the `config_dir` should be settled at the ConfigManager level, not passing that one from the notebookapp level... this is why I submitted 882.\nMy comment on https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/893#issuecomment-167099432 should not also resolve the issue?\n",
