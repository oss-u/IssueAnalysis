Sure. Did he mean it to be taken as a personal assault on all of the developers and their hard work? I'd hope not, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI've been lurking for only a few months on this project, mostly for grins and to learn a bit more about team collaboration on code projects, and over the course of that time I've seen the topic of multiple undo come up two, probably three times. In all circumstances, someone on the thread remarked how it's easy to accidentally screw up a notebook to where they can't get it back to where they want it. Since some people use this tool for Serious Work, they will naturally be upset if the tool lets them shoot themselves in the foot and doesn't provide a way to undo the damage. Those people might be prone to hyperbolic language when talking about their experience.\n\nHaving multiple undo would be one way to help mitigate the situation. There are more ways than one to skin this cat, though, and perhaps it would also be productive to talk about ways to help prevent the user from damaging their notebooks in the first place. Perhaps add barriers between the user and deleting input cells (individually, successively, or _en masse_).\n\nWhat is _not_ productive is snapping at users about how much they should appreciate the work that's already been done. They'll either already appreciate it, or they won't. Dictating to them how much they should appreciate the developers and their work will probably not result in more appreciation. Instead, it is (in my opinion) more likely to result in fewer users, more of whom have a salty taste in their mouth.\n\nFor the record, this project is pretty awesome, and I'm amazed at the ongoing development and collaboration I see every day on it.\n",

I disagree, but it does make it a hard sell to some to use Jupyter, and lack of undo/redo causes some real problems with students. At some point, these usability issues will need to be faced by the project and will have to rise to the top of the priorities. There are a lot of possibilities for things to work on, but these basic use limitations should receive more attention. Note, too, that checkpointing has the same kind of limitation: there is only one. Also, it would be at the top of my votes of priorities. \n",
