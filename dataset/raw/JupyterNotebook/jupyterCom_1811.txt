    "body": "My AV is Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, and actually I'm going to change it. I hope it will helps me. I tryied to discover some logs, but unsuccessfully.\n\nActually, I have discovered another interesting issue. To discover how Jupyter saves files, I change file notebook/services/contents/handlers.py -- I put \"raise ValueError()\" inside _save() function. So, then I watch a call stacktrace and watch a function run() at tornado/gen.py. I have change this function as follows:\n\n```\n                    print(future) #delete_it\n                    value = future.result()\n                    print(value) #delete_it\n```\n\nInstead of just\n                        value = future.result()\n\nand then Jupyter stops to even load my teachers files! I've got a message \"Error loading notebook\nAn unknown error occurred while loading this notebook. This version can load notebook formats v4 or earlier. See the server log for details.\" when I was trying to watch my teachers file, and also in console, there was error log message:\n\nb'GET /api/nbconvert HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8888\\r\\nConnection: keep-alive\\\nr\\nAccept: _/_\\r\\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\\r\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (W\nindows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safar\ni/537.36\\r\\nReferer: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Introduction%20to%20Data%20\nScience/lecture9.ipynb\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch\\r\\nAccept-Languag\ne: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4\\r\\nIf-None-Match: \"0ee129b36ba950a6aac381\nef4a3f3ce5103bf478\"\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n\nFor me it seems like some kind of UB: I just put some print commands, and it fails.\n\nUPD: a call stacktrace:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\notebook\\base\\handlers.py\", line 457,\n```\n\n in wrapper\n        result = yield gen.maybe_future(method(self, _args, *_kwargs))\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\gen.py\", line 1015, in run\n        value = future.result()\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\concurrent.py\", line 237, in\nresult\n        raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)\n      File \"<string>\", line 3, in raise_exc_info\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\gen.py\", line 1021, in run\n        yielded = self.gen.throw(*exc_info)\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\notebook\\services\\contents\\handlers.p\ny\", line 244, in put\n        yield gen.maybe_future(self._save(model, path))\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\gen.py\", line 1015, in run\n        value = future.result()\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\concurrent.py\", line 237, in\nresult\n        raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)\n      File \"<string>\", line 3, in raise_exc_info\n      File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tornado\\gen.py\", line 285, in wrapper\n\n```\n    yielded = next(result)\n  File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\notebook\\services\\contents\\handlers.p\n```\n\ny\", line 182, in _save\n        raise ValueError()\n",
