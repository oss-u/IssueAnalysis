    "body": "Hi @arahim230 - I can't speak to the widget portion of this, but you should see some indication if the kernel (processing your notebook cells) died in the notebook console's output.  Typically, this would manifest itself in the form of a series of automatic restarts when the server detects the kernel process has stopped responding.  You can also look for the kernel process (this will be a python process if using the python kernel) using your platform's process command (e.g., `ps` on *nix platforms).  The kernel process's parent should be the PID of the notebook server.  Of course, this only indicates if the _process_ is still \"running\", but there could be issues within the process that are preventing its actual processing of cells.\r\n\r\nIf your front-end has only lost connection with the kernel, you might try reconnecting to the kernel.  The option to do that is located in the kernel tab.  I don't know if this action would re-enable the widget manager that went missing.",
