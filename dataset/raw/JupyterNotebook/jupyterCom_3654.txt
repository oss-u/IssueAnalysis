    "body": "HI, \n\nWhen the problem shows up I see the reconnect icon top right of page going on and off. When it acts up I can't place the cursor or do any editing of the notebook. I can't run any scripts. \n\nIt is like jupyter notebook just disconnected. When it comes back it usually isn't long enough to do anything more than mess up what I was trying to edit. \n\nThanks for the response. \n\nDale Hoover \n\n\nFrom: \"Thomas Kluyver\" <notifications@github.com> \nTo: \"jupyter/notebook\" <notebook@noreply.github.com> \nCc: \"old-not-dead\" <dale2h@centurylink.net>, \"Author\" <author@noreply.github.com> \nSent: Friday, June 1, 2018 3:50:23 PM \nSubject: Re: [jupyter/notebook] jupyter notebook connection problems (#3654) \n\n\n\nWhat do you see when it goes wrong?
