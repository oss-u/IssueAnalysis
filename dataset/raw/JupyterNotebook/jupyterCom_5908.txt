    "body": "Having poked and prodded quite a bit now, I understand how both branches need a nudge in case of restart:\r\n\r\n- zmq sockets are not recreated when the kernel is restarted (they shouldn't need to be, as zmq does its own underlying auto reconnect).\r\n- There is no similar nudge operation triggered on restart for 'existing' connections\r\n- To prod connections, clients tend to recreate websocket connection on restart (this is not strictly required, but it is a standard practice and may be needed in some cases where the zmq ports change)\r\n- a 'reconnecting' websocket may not actually mean a new zmq socket (the 'restoring connection' branch is taken), if the same session id is re-used\r\n\r\nSo it's possible for a 'new' websocket connection, as part of the client's restart steps, to re-use zmq sockets and thus never nudging the new kernel's sockets.\r\n\r\nThe downside of doing this nudge on every ws connect, even on established, already-nudged zmq sockets, is that websocket connections will not be accepted while the kernel is busy, even though they should be. Currently, it is valid to connect and start sending requests without waiting for iopub, but this can result in the issues folks are seeing. The most robust and efficient nudge would be on:\r\n\r\n1. new zmq connections, and\r\n2. kernel restarts for all existing sockets\r\n\r\nwhere requests on *existing, open sockets* are blocked until the nudge resolves, not just connection-opening. That's more complicated, and I think we can go with this solution as first pass, and refine it later, especially if the delay is bothering folks.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want to look at before merging is what happens if nudge is still outstanding when the connections are closed, then I think this is okay to merge.
