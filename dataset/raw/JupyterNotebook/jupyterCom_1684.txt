    "body": "Hi there, thanks for the proposal, we are aware that we need a better way to show shortcuts to users. \n\nKeyboard shortcuts being extremely scarce when using a browser, I'm worried it  would not such a good idea to reserve one more for this action. \n\nNote that on current master, the command palette (Ctrl-P) doe show the shortcut associated with each actions, and that the help menu now allows you to redefine your shortcuts. \n\nJupyterlab now also introduce the shortcuts in the menu as well; so a shortcut to show shortcut seem a bit too much.\n\nTechnically I guess with the shortcut configurable you can define one one your own if you like, and there is also the chicken and egg problem; how do use fing the shortcut to shop the shortcut help...\n\nWhat do you think ? Do you think the current development on master resolve some of what you are trying to propose ? Do you see any improvement on what's available ?\n",
