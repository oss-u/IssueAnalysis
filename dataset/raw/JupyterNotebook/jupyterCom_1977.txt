Thank you for explaining!\r\n\r\nAgreed, I don't think it's an endorsed shorthand, and it is potentially confusing for those who already know the distinction. \r\n\r\nHowever, the alternative (always distinguishing anaconda from conda) can also be more confusing to those who haven't encountered the distinction between anaconda and miniconda before, since they probably have installed from anaconda (being the strongly more marketed option) and they will rarely need to type the characters `anaconda` again, whereas they will need to type `conda` all the time. Thus, anaconda gets the unofficial shorthand \"conda\". ",
