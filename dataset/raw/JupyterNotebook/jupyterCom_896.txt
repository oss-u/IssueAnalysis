So your proposal in #892 is changing the style we agreed upon. \n\n(Sidenote: I, as a person, would prefer a notebook style with only the left indicator and no border. Though **not changing that** is what we agreed upon. We agreed to **only add a left indicator** for 4.1)\n\n> We _are_ changing the visual design of cells in 4.1 and I don't see any way to avoid that. For example we and everyone else says \"command mode has a Grey border\" but that is no longer true either.\n\nHum, my cells on 4.1rc still have grey border. \nThe blue indicator on the left is in the background:\n\n```\ndiv.cell.selected {\n    border-color: #ababab; // this is gray. \n    // this is blue and then transparent. \n    background: linear-gradient(to right, #42A5F5 -40px, #42A5F5 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 100%);\n}\n```\n\n> Bad visual design at this level is a bug and in most cases we should fix it in in minor releases\n\nAgreed, but not at the expense of breaking user habits, all tutorials, and books published. E.g. @jdfreder videos. \n\n> Keep in mind that none of these major new UI features should have been done in 4.1, so all of this is a compromise at this point.\n\nYes, and 4.1 have been slow changing for a few weeks, had a **beta** and a **rc** cycle which were already including the compromise style we agreed upon. And you are asking major UI changes 24 to 48 hours from a potential release.\n\nI'm open to accept **some changes**, because I deeply trust you, and you are someone sensible to design. But as a maintainer it's really hard lang huge change that close to reelease. \n",
