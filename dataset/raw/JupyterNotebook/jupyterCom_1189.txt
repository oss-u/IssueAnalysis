    "body": "This is an issue of your math being interpreted as HTML. Your `<k` is being interpreted as opening a `<k>` HTML tag, which then includes the rest of the document, hence the apparent truncation. There are subtle differences (not intentional ones) in how we handle math in markdown between the browser and nbconvert. In this particular case, you can avoid the issue by putting space around `<`: use `j < k` instead of `j<k` and it should be happy.\n",
