    "body": "I think there's a couple of different things going on there:\r\n\r\n1. Backspace processing (`fixBackspace()` in `notebook/static/base/js/utils.js`) isn't correctly handling consecutive backspaces when they arrive together. That should be fixable.\r\n2. In the terminal, backspace moves the cursor back, and printing another character overwrites it. We're not emulating a proper terminal, so we don't track a cursor position, but we support a limited subset of terminal-like behaviour by processing some control characters and escape sequences. I think that in this scope, treating backspace as 'delete the last character' is 'good enough'.",
