    "body": "Hi,\n\nI am seeing the same error messages. In our setup we are serving notebooks from a Samba share, and I am pretty sure that is the root cause of the error. (To be precise we are running Jupyter in a Docker container, based on the official Docker images but heavily customised, and the share is a [File Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/) on Azure, which is mounted using the SMB3 protocol on the Linux host, so it is quite complicated, but I think most of that is not related.)\n\nI have checked the developer tools in my browser and found the debug message recently added to Jupyter:\n\n```\nLast saving was done on `Mon Feb 15 2016 20:55:38 GMT+0100 (CET)`\n(save-success:2016-02-15T19:55:38.909885+00:00), \nwhile the current file seem to have been saved on \n`2016-02-15T19:55:38.977767+00:00`\n```\n\nAs you can see there is really only a very small difference, a fraction of a second, and it definitely seems to be a timestamp issue between the host and the SMB server.\n\nSimilar issues have been reported for numerous tools over the years, including [Eclipse](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=137011), [Gedit](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gedit/+bug/34813), [Emacs](https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11078) and [Samba](https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4076) itself [multiple times](https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6925), and you can find references to Samba shares and also VirtualBox shares in the comments. \n\nAs far as I can see in the linked bug reports some tools are still unfixed, while others (most notably Eclipse) managed to work around this by changing how they check for changes. Is there a chance a similar change can be applied in Jupyter without breaking existing functionality for everyone else?\n\nThanks,\nAdam\n",

    "body": "In my analysis of the bugs in other products, the reason that this issue is pervasive in many projects is not that there's an unresolved problem in Samba. It's pervasive because it's hard to get right, because of various levels of caching at the Samba and filesystem layers and multiple opportunities to pull clock information from sometimes asynchronous sources. I believe that's why it manifests in VMs as well.\n\nEclipse uses native platform APIs to track file changes, like inotify I suppose. They decided to automatically background refresh non-dirty editor windows.\n\nI don't know the codebase, but from snooping a bit, I can't find where the `FileContentsManager.save()` updates `model` with the last modified time after saving. It may be that this model returned from save() discarded and a new object is created with a subsequent call to get(), and maybe in the time between cals we see the issue.\n\nAnother possible approach that should be tolerant of clock skew and Samba bugs:\n-calculate a hash for the file while saving\n-if last modified timestamps indicate a change, and the time window is small, calculate the hash of the new file and compare to the hash of the last known saved file\n\nSince notification of a file changed in the background doesn't need to be immediate, the hashes can be calculated in a background thread/task/coroutine. The hash of the last saved file doesn't even need to be saved, if a copy is left in memory until needed.\n",
