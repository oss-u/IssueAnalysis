    "body": "@gnestor here's my rudimentry PR. You'll immediately notice my rather direct approach to solving this problem. I wonder if we would be better served by adding an independent `this.display_keybindings()` step in the constructor, e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (this.selector !== undefined) {\r\n            this.element = $(selector);\r\n            this.style();\r\n            this.add_bundler_items();\r\n            this.bind_events();\r\n            this.render_keybindings();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as to keep the intent clear. Very pleased to hear thoughts and critique!",

    "body": "Thanks @aaronmyatt! I like your thought of adding a `render_keybindings` method to `MenuBar` because it sounds more elegant, but your current implementation works and it conveniently has access to the actions list and the menu item index, whereas something like `this.render_keybindings()` would require a second iteration through the menu items and a move of the actions list out of `this.bind_events`.\r\n\r\nI cleaned up the styles and I can push to your branch, but it looks like I don't permission. Can you check the \"Allow maintainers to edit\" checkbox in the right column of this PR on Github?",
