If I leave my mouse over a cell, then move around with the keyboard, the play button stays on the cell hovered over, even when the mouse pointer disappears - then it seems like there is this arbitrary play button next to one of the cells, which isn't the current cell, but does change as I scroll the notebook in the page.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that we can't fix these sorts of issues, of course.

I'm frustrated by this issue because:\r\n\r\n* The feature was worked on in two pull requests which no-one besides me reviewed (#3437, #3535).\r\n* I merged it nearly two months ago, and I'm not aware of any complaints while it was in master.\r\n* M improved on it in a third pull request, still without any real review (#3687).\r\n* We made a release candidate a few weeks back. No feedback.\r\n* I find the time to get a real release out, and within hours I've got a complaint saying it should be reverted.\r\n\r\nIt feels like there's a huge imbalance between how many people care about the notebook and how many people are willing to be involved in the development process.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this feels like the kind of complaint provoked by any UI change: it's not what we're used to, we'll find a reason that it's objectively bad, and then demand that it be reverted. The fact that it comes so soon after a release reinforces this impression.\r\n\r\nGiven the process this has already been through, I don't see what \"letting it bake\" more in master will achieve: clearly next to no-one is running from master, so it can either 'bake' indefinitely or we can replay this the next time someone tries to include it in a release.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see concrete suggestions for improving the feature, even if that's only \"hide it except on touchscreen devices\", rather than people just requesting that it be reverted and *someone else* should improve it. It was meant to solve a real issue, and I don't want to have to tell a contributor that their accepted PR was reverted.",

On the flip side, I know it's hard to try to run master and keep up with the development of many different projects.\r\n\r\n@gnestor - thanks for summarizing. My main objection is with the hover-based UI, and how that distracts from my normal notebook workflow. I would be interested in hearing from others what the driving use-case is for a run button by the cell, and particularly how that is better than the run button on the toolbar. If it does make a huge difference on touchscreens for example (it seems like it might?), then showing it only on touchscreens makes sense to me. I would still not make it follow the mouse hover in that case, though, since following the mouse position doesn't make sense on a touch screen.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for bringing this up, @ivanov! I also think it's something we can and should fix. I think only on touch screens is a good option, since it doesn't seem to be working well when you have a mouse cursor, but still solves the direct problem on touch screens that it was hard to execute without a keyboard. I like #3776 as a solution, at least for the interim. I still think the idea of a cell context/action area may be a good one for the future, if we can figure out the UI for it, but the sparse nature of the document part of the UI is very precious to a lot of users so it's a tough balance to strike.\r\n\r\nI agree that with the current state of things, 'baking in master' is not very useful at this point for UI. As @takluyver said, this baked in master for some time without objection. That's always going to happen, though—the number of people running from releases is huge compared to those running from master or release candidates. So we need to be prepared for feedback after releases, even for things that have been reviewed and in master for a long time. The lack of PR reviewing attention on this repo is something we definitely need to work on.",

I only became aware of it when I upgraded my jupyter install and noticed the new behavior in my notebooks.\r\n\r\nI agree with the discussion point: \"The new play button is distracting because it's constantly being displayed and hidden whenever a cell is entered/exited\".  Things appearing and disappearing on screen grab my attention.  I actively disable just about any and every pop-up and alert system on my technology devices because my work requires extreme focus -- which I have a hard enough time generating because of my own faults.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I would very much support some combination of (1) default disabled and (2) easy option to disable the per-cell play button.",
