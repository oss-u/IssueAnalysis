    "body": "This issue affects us as well (in notebook rather than lab). Launching notebook from JuputerHub and the user just gets a 500 message because  it attempts to write to `~/.local/share/jupyter/runtime`.  We got around it for a little while by playing with `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR` but we've now moved to do a check in `pre_spawn_hook`. @yuvipanda this is a continuation of the discussion we were having at the Jupyter/HPC meeting.",
