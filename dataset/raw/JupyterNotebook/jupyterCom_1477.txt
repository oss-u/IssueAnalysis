Deleted that copy.\n3) Copied python2 kernel folder.  Did a kernelspec list. Result: Good List.\n4) Opened kernel.json in \"TextWrangler\" (high quality editor imo) changed name. Saved. Did a kernelspec list. Result: Good list.\n\nSo, has something to do with saving with default text editor on mac, which I suspect changes the encoding causing a JSON parse error in the list.  Not sure other than that.  Suspect line endings?  Dunno.\n",
