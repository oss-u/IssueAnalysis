I'm not asking for a backport (I contributed it, here), and I agreed with you that we consider this a 5.0 feature (good call!) - perhaps I should have closed this PR at that point. Sorry, I don't mean to set your priorities or imply your priorities are wrong - on the contrary, I really applaud your and others' focus and work on moving forward with notebook 5.0. We're also working hard on trying to get an overdue ipywidgets 6.0 out the door too.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate the 4.4 release, which was a real blocker for ipywidgets (thus a really high priority for us), and I'm of course willing to help with potential problems from the changes we contributed.",
