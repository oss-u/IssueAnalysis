Could you confirm that you can open the default python program without issues? It is usually stored at: \r\n\"C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\python.exe\", (your one could be a little different if you have administrator access)\r\nAlso please check if your Jupyter is pointing to the correct location for the Python Kernel. \r\n\r\nAs for my case, I still do not know what went wrong with my settings but I have fixed the issue by \"hard reset\". To do a hard rest (restore Jupyter profile settings to default):\r\n\r\n1.\tCreated a new iPython profile: $ ipython profile create foo \r\n2.     Rename your default one to something else\r\n2.\tRename profile_foo to profile_default\r\n3.\tInitialize a Jupyter profile: $ jupyter notebook --generate-config\r\n\r\nReinstalling anaconda does not change any user profiles and that was why I could not fix my issue by reinstalling. You will LOSE any settings you have applied but at least you get a working Jupyter again.  ",
