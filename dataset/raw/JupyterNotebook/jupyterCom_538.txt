    "body": "IMHO bindings should be (have to be) case-insentive. \n\nFor example, there is no way to type capital letter `A` with a single unmodified keystroke. What you do is type `shift-a`. That is to say, the case of a letter is a product of its numeric key code and a modifier. \n\nThis means that the key binding `shift-+` is invalid because there is no way to type the `+` key without a modifier. That binding (on a US keyboard) would be expressed as `shift-=`. \n\nThe [phosphor-keymap](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-keymap) repo went live at the end of last week, and @blink1073 is working towards a PR which uses that to implement these shortcuts. It supports arbitrary length chords as well as scoping via CSS selectors (ala Atom). It treats bindings in a case-insensitive manner. It uses `+` as the separator though, since `+` is not a valid key character like `-` is.\n\nWith that technical stuff out of the way, I definitely think they should be presented to the user in the UI in a readable form. My personal preference for this is cap-cased modifiers with capitalized primary keys:\n\n`Ctrl-Shift-A`, `Alt-3`, `D D`, `Ctrl-Alt-F5`, etc...\n",
