    "body": "What's happening here is a result of [this line](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/52e48afa6d3d508c83115c142c3f8fd0dc477108/lib/codemirror.js#L4002) in CodeMirror. The logic is a bit subtle, but I will try to explain as best I can.\n\nWhen you scroll using the trackpad or the mouse wheel, the browser delivers `'wheel'` events to the DOM element under the cursor. These events bubble up the DOM like most other mouse events, and if `preventDefault()` is not called on the event, the default action will be to scroll the element/page. For kinetic (momentum) scrolling, the browser continues to generate `'wheel'` events until the scrolling comes to rest. As the page is scrolled, the element under the cursor will change and hence the element receiving the `'wheel'` events will change.\n\nThis explains the immediate observation that the jitter (slow scrolling) only occurs when the cursor is over a CodeMirror cell. When the cursor is in the left margin of the notebook, or in-between CodeMirror cells, the CodeMirror `'wheel'` event handler is not invoked.\n\nThe line of code linked above prevents the event default action, which means the browser **will not** scroll the page when that code path is taken. So, why do we get _some_ vertical scrolling during jitter, instead of _none_? The answer is that a wheel event can contain both `deltaX` and `deltaY` values simultaneously. When using an actual mouse wheel, the `deltaX` will be zero. But when using a trackpad, `deltaX` will only sometimes be zero (because humans are imprecise).\n\nWhen CodeMirror encounters any non-zero `deltaX` value, it will take the code path linked above, which will unconditionally prevent the default scroll action. Presumably, this is done so that horizontally scrolling the editor does not _also_ horizontally scroll the page. This is a reasonable behavior, but leads to the unfortunate issue we are seeing here where it falsely prevents the vertical scroll of the page. When scrolling with a trackpad, what we end up with is a stream of `'wheel'` events with small `deltaX` values, some of which are zero. As those events are processed by CodeMirror, it prevents the default scroll action on all except the ones with a zero `deltaX`. It is _these_ events which actually get handled by the browser and cause the vertical scroll. But since they are only processed sporadically, the result is jitter.\n\nThere is [a clause](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/52e48afa6d3d508c83115c142c3f8fd0dc477108/lib/codemirror.js#L3974) near the top of CodeMirror's `'wheel'` event handler, which bails early if there is no content to scroll. This explains why the jitter is only observed for CodeMirror cells which have overflowing content (i.e. visible scrollbars).\n\nI can see a few solutions for this problem:\n1. Comment out the line which prevents the event default in the version of CodeMirror we ship. I tested this locally and it works fine. The downside is possible horizontal scrolling of the page when horizontally scrolling the cell contents. This probably won't actually be a problem since the notebook itself rarely has horizontal scrollbars. It could be a problem in a larger app though. This is the simplest \"solution\".\n2. Apply some form of thresholding to the `deltaX` value in the version of CodeMirror we ship, so that only significant `deltaX` values are actually handled by CodeMirror. This is also reasonably simple.\n3. Update the code cell so that only the active editing cell is actually a live CodeMirror instance. At all other times, the code cell should just be a static rendering of the code mirror content. [CodeMirror.runMode](https://codemirror.net/demo/runmode.html) can be used for this. This is a bit of work, but is the cleanest solution and would also likely solve some other performance concerns we have. IMHO this is the \"right\" way to solve the problem.\n\nA few other random thoughts:\n- This issue probably only affects OSX users using trackpads. These pads allow simultaneous X and Y scrolling. My experience with other trackpads is that they will \"lock\" so that only a single axis is scrolled at a time. [Relevant Stack Exchange](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106935/fix-mavericks-vertical-scrolling-lock-jerky-scrolling-accidental-safari-back).\n- CodeMirror is using deprecated APIs on `'wheel'` event (`'wheelDeltaX'` vs `'deltaX'`, etc.) which generate very different numbers from the standard APIs. This may exacerbate the situation. The standard APIs are support by all major browsers back to IE9.\n- I think it may be worth pinging Marijn to get a bit more insight into his intentions behind preventing the default scroll action, and the use of the deprecated event APIs.\n",
