I would prefer `tab`/`shift tab` to move quickly between `search` and `replace` field, if we put it before, it will be 2 press. We can change the tabindex, but then the tab selection order might be confusing. \n\nNo objection to **try**, though I want to keep the keyboard usability in mind. \n",

I'd either need to sync the check state with the button state or keep the checkbox static. Not to mention, on some operating systems/browsers, check boxes aren't that pretty.\n",
