    "body": "FWIW, I do agree that cleaning is a mess.\n\nNormally, this ends up being worse after any sort of testing stage as there really is no interest in keeping such a layer. Instead one is only interested in validating the previously layer works as expected and then continuin/finishing the build without any changes to the final layer caused by testing.\n\nThis is certainly not the first time I have seen this issue and felt I should raise it after our discussion here with particular regards to testing. I created an issue here ( https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/16993 ) if you are interested. There are some workarounds proposed relating to local builds and builds on Docker Hub. The real solution will likely rely on some sort of nested build implementation. There are many proposals the most notable being this one ( https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7115 ). In addition to helping with testing, it seems this proposal might make it easier to avoid clean up at almost any `RUN` step by doing a nested build and only including the needed build artifacts.\n\nHowever, as it is very versatile it will take some honing before it makes it into `master` or a release for that matter. Whether or not the final implementation uses something like [`dind`](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/docker/) would determine how versatile this solution would be. Currently, this sort of syntax change is blocked by the freezing of the `Dockerfile` syntax ( https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#22-dockerfile-syntax ). FWICT, it is unclear when the `Dockerfile` syntax will be unfrozen.\n\nIn short, given the interest and people behind this change we can be fairly certain we will see something to alleviate this problem, but given the current blockers it won't be soon.\n",
