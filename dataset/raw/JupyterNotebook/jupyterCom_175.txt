    "body": "The way Notebook Server works we abstract the dealing with file through the \"contents manager\", so that the frontend is unaware that the backend is Filesystem, Postgres, GoogleDrive, DropBox, or whatever. \nBaking git in would break that assumption, and force us to deal with the case where git is not installed. \nAlso why git and not mercurial. The git operation that you want to do sand support start to be complex and require lots of UI  (that even github does not provide). \n\nSo we are staying (and will probably stay) away from adding git in our interface for a log time. \n\nThough,  the notebook server support extensions, and you should have all the hooks necessary in Notebook to do that. \n\nWe'll do a basic on how to write extension at SciPy in a couple of weeks, with some written docs if you cannot attend. \n\nClosing as this is not something we will have in the core, but feel free to ask questions if you want to try writing an extension.\n",
