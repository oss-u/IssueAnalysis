I don't think we need a UI to help with linking external files — that is easy already: you just drag and drop the file into the same directory and add an image link to markdown.\n\nWhereas right now it is insanely hard to embed an image in the notebook file itself unless the image is the result of code execution, and this makes it extremely unreliable to share (email, upload, copy to dropbox...) notebooks with markdown images without breaking them.\n\nMoreover, when someone drags-and-drops or pastes an image into a notebook, what they will expect is that it is stored in the notebook.  This is the behavior people are familiar with from other contexts like word processors.  It is especially true for copy/paste or drag-and-drop of images that don't come from a file (e.g. pasting/dragging a selection from an image-editor program or from another web page).\n",

We get regular complaints about putting output into the JSON.\n\n> Right now, in my experience, people simply avoid using images in markdown cells as much as possible because of this inconvenience\n\nAnd my experience is the opposite—since it's so convenient to use regular files in markdown and the behavior is so much better, I use relatively linked images in markdown all the time. For this reason, I thought that the convenience of upload was the only aspect this was meant to address, e.g. matching what GitHub image upload does.\n\n> the same argument would apply to storing plots and other code-generated images in the notebook vs. separate files.\n\nI don't agree, or at least I think the tradeoffs end up being different. Generated outputs and uploaded files are different in many ways. Outputs change on every execution of the notebook, and are reasonably discarded by users who do not want to track non-input content.\n",

We either automatically remove attachments that are not referenced in the markdown (at render time).\n2. We let the user delete attachments manually using the \"Edit Attachments\" dialog (which should be improved).\n\nOption 1 is easier for the user; he doesn't event need to know what an attachment is to use the feature. With this option, I am not sure an \"Edit Attachments\" dialog is still useful, although it could be used to view an attachments' size.\n\nAny thoughts ?\n",
