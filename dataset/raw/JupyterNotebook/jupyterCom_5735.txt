    "body": "In briefly looking into this and starting [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/13605), this appears to be an issue with `parso` and conda in that conda is installing `parso 0.8` in python 3.5 environments despite the fact that `parso` 0.8 does not support Python 3.5.  A workaround that has been successful appears to be a downgrade of `parso` to `0.7`.\r\n\r\nSince this is not related to this repository, I'm closing the issue.",
