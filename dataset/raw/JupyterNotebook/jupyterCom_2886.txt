This is useful in some situations, but it's not the main focus of the project, and it's not intended to replace the many more powerful editors and IDEs already available.",

As @takluyver mentioned - the reason the cell insert and kernel top level menus are \"missing\" is because this is a plain .py file opened with an editor, not a notebook.\r\n\r\nIn addition, @dr-blink - the tone of your message, using all capital letters, excessive exclamation marks , soliciting a \"REAL solution\" is insulting and not appropriate.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone and happy hacking! :bowtie:",
