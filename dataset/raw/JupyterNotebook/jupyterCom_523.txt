    "body": "Not positive but I think it is related to the fact that I installed jupyter\nwith pip and not conda.  I am using conda but installed jupyter with pip\nbecause I was having trouble getting notebook entensions to work with the\nversion that was in conda distribution.  I guess my extensions problem was\nfixed when jupyter was upgraded to 4.0.6., but then realized I have this\nproblem with not being able to shutdown notebooks.  Then I wondered if\njupyter got updated in conda so I re-made my conda environment and\ninstalled jupyter with conda instead of pip.  Now, everything's good!\nOn Oct 6, 2015 12:08 PM, \"Brian E.
