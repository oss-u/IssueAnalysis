    "body": "I have tried the feature and it seems to work. The kernel are indeed culled after the specified timeout (approximately). This is great because I have many users (through jupyterhub) that work on many notebooks, and they rarely take the time to shutdown their kernels before moving on to the next notebook. Thus the server eventually runs out of memory... but sometimes they need to come bak to a previous notebook.\r\n\r\nI noticed that if the user leaves his notebook opened, he is not alerted that his kernel is gone. Is this normal behavior? Isn't there some kind of heartbeat mechanism where the opened notebook is suppose to ask the user if he wants to restart the kernel? I believe this mechanism exists, because I've seen it in action before, but it doesn't seem to be applied here? ",
