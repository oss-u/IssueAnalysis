I believe the default (certainly an option) is to hide by default when using a gesture-enabled trackpad, but always show scroll bars if a mouse is in use.\r\n\r\nIf CodeMirror is measuring assuming a scroll bar would always be present, but it isn't, we could get this behavior (cutoff of the width of one scroll bar). To enable this behavior explicitly:\r\n\r\n    System Preferences > General > Show scroll bars: When scrolling\r\n\r\nIt's possible it's specifically an interacting with the 'When scrolling' setting.

    "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI run jupyter notebook (4.2.3-4) on Debian \"sid\" with Google Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium, and they all exhibit the same problem: \r\n\r\n- When ever a current cell gets focus (cursor moves in, click, typing), the height of the cell increases by 85px.  \r\n\r\nI see that by running the DOM inspector.  For what it is worth, I use Gnome-shell, not that I think it matters. Also, this applies whether I use a physical mouse or touchpad.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a sub-DIV of a DIV with class `CodeMirror-vscrollbar` which has it's height changed - it's not the class but the element directly in a STYLE attribute. \r\n```\r\n<div class=CodeMirror-vscrollbar>\r\n  <div style=\"height: x; width: y\"></div> <!-- This is the div that changes height -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nBreaking  attribute changes on the sub-DIV, I see the change happens in `codemirror.js` around line 426 (in my version) of the function NativeScrollbars.update:\r\n```\r\nNativeScrollbars.prototype = copyObj({\r\n    update: function(measure) {\r\n      var needsH = measure.scrollWidth > measure.clientWidth + 1; // false\r\n      var needsV = measure.scrollHeight > measure.clientHeight + 1; // true\r\n      var sWidth = measure.nativeBarWidth; // 0\r\n\r\n      if (needsV) { // needsV is true\r\n        this.vert.style.display = \"block\";\r\n        this.vert.style.bottom = needsH ? sWidth + \"px\" : \"0\";\r\n        var totalHeight = measure.viewHeight - (needsH ? sWidth : 0); //measure.viewheight=888,\r\n        // A bug in IE8 can cause this value to be negative, so guard it.\r\n        this.vert.firstChild.style.height =\r\n          Math.max(0, measure.scrollHeight - measure.clientHeight + totalHeight) + \"px\";//This is what seems to grow\r\n      } else {\r\n        this.vert.style.display = \"\";\r\n        this.vert.firstChild.style.height = \"0\";\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nIt's a rather annoying bug that makes the note-book entirely useless. \r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nChristian",
