If the default threshold is high enough, it will cover the immense majority of cases and I doubt anyone will ever notice. \n\nAnd the rare person who really needs to display 1,000,000 lines of text in their notebooks for some bizarre reason, can always bump up the threshold.\n\nThis could be prototyped purely on the IPython kernel by hooking directly into its execution engine, and if it works well, it could be put on the server itself as a filter that applies to all kernels before data is sent out to the clients.\n\nThis would alleviate the need for lots of UI design on this topic.\n",
