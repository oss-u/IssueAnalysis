    "body": "You can use CSS to show/hide each of the different output _types_ (result, display, stdout, stderr). Each output type has a different css class, so you can use `display: none` on these classes to hide what you want. The notebook does _not_ have semantic information about things like warnings, though, so 'intention' is not available information. That would have to be done in the kernel, e.g. by using Python's warning filter system in the case of IPython.\n\nI don't think you can generally distinguish between _types_ of output for what's used for development and what's used for presentation. I have done plenty of presentations were I use every single output type Jupyter understands. You may, at the library level, be able to distinguish between what is 'presentation output' and what is 'debugging output', but Jupyter cannot, and probably most Kernels cannot, either.\n",
