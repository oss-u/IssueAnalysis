    "body": "This is appears to be a duplicate of #5124.  I can't tell what solutions you have attempted, but now that notebook 6.0.3 is available, please try upgrading notebook.  \r\n\r\n`pip install notebook --upgrade`\r\n\r\nor, for conda envs,\r\n\r\n`conda update -c conda-forge notebook`\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely familiar with python package managers (pip and conda) and it looks like you might have a combination of things in play here (`--user`?).  But I can determine you're running code that has been changed recently so its best to get you up on that.\r\n\r\nOnce completed, you should see that `jupyter_client` and `jupyter_core` have versions `5.3.4` and `4.6.1`, respectively.  If the problem still persists, please provide the updated traceback since it should provide more helpful information.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
