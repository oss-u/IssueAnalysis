    "body": "On Unix platforms, interrupts generally work by sending the SIGINT signal, which can interrupt running code. It shouldn't be necessary to use threads for this, and threads would probably cause more issues than they'd solve. If it's not working for sql magic, the first thing would be to establish why - please open an issue on ipython-sql for that.\r\n\r\nThings are a bit different on Windows, because it doesn't have the same signalling mechanism. I think that if the code is in a blocking C call, it won't be interrupted until control returns to Python.",
