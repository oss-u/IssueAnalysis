In Jupyterlab, there is this issue jupyterlab/jupyterlab#6846 which says that the `extraKeys` config referenced in the CodeMirror issue is not available to Jupyterlab.  I'm not sure if it works in regular notebook; I can't figure out how/where I would insert such a modification to the config.\r\n\r\nI continue to find this probably the single largest annoyance when editing text with the notebook.  The current behavior in which Home acts on the logical line and End acts on the visual line is totally nonsensical and it would be really great if it could be fixed.",
