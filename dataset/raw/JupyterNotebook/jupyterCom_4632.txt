There should be an error message prior to this traceback that contains the command string used in the Popen call.  That is most likely the subject of the `Errno 2` as that command is not accessible for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nIf you don't see the logged error, which should start with a string like `Failed to run command:`, check the kernel.json's `argv` stanza corresponding to the JS kernel and ensure the first entry is accessible or, better yet, fully qualified.",
