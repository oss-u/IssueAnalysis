If you know that the pid is no longer associated with a notebook process, then, by all means, it would be safe (and advised) to delete the file.  If, on the other hand, you know the associated notebook server is running, then it's up to you (and your usage of the 'list' and 'stop' commands) as to whether you should delete the file since its premature deletion will prevent those commands from producing expected results.\r\n\r\nThe file will be automatically deleted on \"controlled\" stops (either via ctrl-C or 'stop').",
