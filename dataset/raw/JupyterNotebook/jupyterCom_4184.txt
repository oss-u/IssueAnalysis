    "body": "More importantly, is this actually useful? The problem motivating it in #4183 isn't really solved by making it configurable - as you point out, extensions are loaded too late to influence creating the event loop. @mrocklin has a workaround for dask (https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/2343), and I'm not aware of anyone else who has asked for this.\r\n\r\nHow the event loop is created seems like squarely an application concern, so I'm -1 on making it configurable unless there's a clear use case that's not better solved another way. The more bits that can be configured, the harder it is to change the underlying code later.",
