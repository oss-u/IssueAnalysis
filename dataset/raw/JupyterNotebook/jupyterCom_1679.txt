The easiest way to do that is by setting environment variables (`JUPYTER_DATA_DIR` and `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR`). But I wouldn't really recommend it: information that refers to the normal locations will be confusing, and if any tools assume the standard location without checking the environment variables, they won't work for you.\n",
