The suggestion is to paste the file URI scheme into your browser's address bar and it should resolve to the Notebook UI appearing and managing the files located in the current directory - just as the other links produce.\r\n\r\nAre you seeing otherwise?",

I use the other links which i did not posted here, because they are working.\r\n\r\nif there is any method to edit or recreate this file on its specific location? That's what I wanted to know, just to see the command line Error free.\r\n\r\nIn old times in DOS the path, config file or autoexec files were used to solve the problems. And now, I'm Zeeeero.ðŸ™Š",
