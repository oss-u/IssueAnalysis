    "body": "The dev team has been mulling over the internationalization of documentation, UI, etc. in the core itself for some time... some new work coming up might actually encourage that. \n\nI think supporting actually _authoring_ multiple languages in a notebook would be great. That would be worth an extension, and might actually require a change to the notebook format. no doubt this has been discussed before.\n\nBut to go quick and dirty, a bookmarklet-kind of thing would be great. It could certainly add a new button. You can hook into when markdown cells are rendered, and apply a translation. Here's an example of hooking that event:\n- https://github.com/bollwyvl/nb-mermaid/blob/c52be964e23f366cc40889a3fe8b8055ca95e63d/nb-mermaid.js#L48\n\nCode comments would be harder... the best approach would probably be \"line widgets\":\n- https://codemirror.net/demo/widget.html\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have any examples of using that in the notebook.\n",
