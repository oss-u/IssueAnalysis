If you drop a file in `.jupyter/nbextension/` and modify `~/.jupyter/nbconfig/tree.json`, `~/.jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.json`, `~/.jupyter/nbconfig/edit.json` like so:\n\n```\ncat ~/.jupyter/nbconfig/tree.json\n{\n  \"load_extensions\": {\n    \"jupyter_cms/dashboard/main\": true,\n    \"ipyparallel/main\": true,\n    \"assignment_list/main\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(here I have 3 extensions enabled)\n\nYou can tell which extension to enable on which page, independently. And these files and layout is programmatically modifiable, which is better to install automatically multiple extensions. `custom.js` is just an artifact of the past (really we should just get rid of it ), but people are still using it, and it's damned convenient.\n",
