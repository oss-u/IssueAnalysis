    "body": "OK, this has just occurred again, and it happened without any cell being executed in the notebook. I had just started jupyter in a project and opened one notebook. As I was scrolling down, the interface locked up. Looking at the activity monitor, I noticed that the process was quickly gobbling up memory, until it hit just over 14GB. The notebook then became responsive again, and the memory consumption dropped down to just over 10GB. However, this was still without any cells being executed. Here is the current memory consumption info from this process:\r\n\r\n `http://localhost:8890, â€¦\t10.74 GB\t6.42 GB\t7\t196\t18075\tfonnescj\t39.9\t2:20.86\t1`\t\r\n\r\nI can confirm that it occurs every time I load the following notebook and scroll around on it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fonnesbeck/intro_stat_modeling_2017/blob/master/notebooks/2.%20Basic%20Bayesian%20Inference.ipynb\r\n\r\nI noticed that there is a MathJax loading message in the status bar when it happens, so perhaps it is related?",
