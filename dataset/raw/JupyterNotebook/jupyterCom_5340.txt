    "body": "Hi cemakinci, the files that are shown will depend on the folder where you activated your jupyter lab instance. The simplest way to display the files that you are looking for would be to navigate to the directory you want to work in. \r\n\r\n`cd path/to/working/directory`\r\n\r\nand then activate your jupyter lab instance from there. \r\n\r\n`jupyter lab`\r\n\r\nThey have made a deliberate change in jupyter lab such that it is now not possible to navigate the entire file system. Hope that helps. \r\n\r\n----\r\nBy the way there is a long discussion on this in issue [#2532](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2532). If you want more background then feel free to head over there. ",
