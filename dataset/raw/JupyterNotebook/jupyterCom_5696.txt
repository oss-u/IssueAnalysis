    "body": "In looking around I found [your post on discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/how-to-make-file-manager-use-kerberos-ticket/5712) - including here for completeness.\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebook, and the contents service in general,  is certainly unaware of things like Kerberos and even the underlying storage mechanism, including NFS and its variants.  These types of low-level subsystems do not typically require application-level changes.  Sure, a Kerberos ticket may need to be refreshed for a given user from time to time, but that's beyond the scope of the current notebook server.\r\n\r\nIf you figure out what additional support is required to get this working, I think it might be useful to [`jupyter_server`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server) given it is viewed as the next notebook server.  In the meantime, I'm going to close this issue but invite any updates you may have.  We can then reopen it as needed and/or transfer to `jupyter_server`.",

Yeah, it would be good to know what might be necessary as there might be ways to plumb the appropriate config options to accommodate that, and hopefully, the EOS devs can add some insights.  I don't mean to imply there's nothing jupyter _can do_.  Just that its currently something jupyter _doesn't do_.\r\n\r\nHave you tried approaching this from the Hub side of things since that's what creates the notebook server instance in the first place?  Perhaps there's some form of initialization that can be configured as part of spawning each server?",
