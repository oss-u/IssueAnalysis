The error is coming from code that's meant to prevent against replay attacks by blocking messages with the same signature as a previous message.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing a bit, but I think the issue is with the new activity monitoring; previously, messages from the kernel were only deserialised once (to be reserialised as JSON to go to the browser). Now iopub messages are deserialised a second time to update the kernel's state. If that happens with the same session object, then it will attempt to parse the same message twice, leading to the error you see.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is why we don't run into that when using the notebook server normally. @minrk ?",

Other tools will see tar.gz are more recent than .whl, leading to some useless extra install step, like forcing user to have node locally while they should not need it.
