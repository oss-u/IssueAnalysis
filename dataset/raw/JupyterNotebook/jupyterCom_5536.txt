    "body": "Hi @angrosamund.  \r\n\r\nThis information, coupled with the information provided on #5535, implies that your home directory is actually coming from a mounted filesystem.  In this case, based on the way the filesystem is mounted or its type, applications are unable to affect file permissions - which results in the inability of the framework to write files securely.  There are typically 3 choices at this point:\r\n\r\n1. If security is not a concern or you know you're operating within a trusted environment, then you can set the environment variable `JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES=1` and restart your Notebook server process.  This instructs `jupyter_core.secure_write()` to bypass permission enforcement.\r\n2. If security is a concern, you can set the environment variable `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR=/directory/not/in/mounted/filesystem` to a directory path that is NOT within this mounted filesystem and restart your Notebook server process.  This will create the kernel connection files in that location, presumably where appropriate permissions can be then be manipulated by `secure_write()`.  In this case, you do not need to set `JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES=1`.\r\n3. Contact your administrator that configured your filesystem mount strategy and ask them to check various mount options as some require additional configuration to preserve ownership and permission behaviors.\r\n\r\nOnce the system believes its written a trusted connection file, you should be moving forward again.",
