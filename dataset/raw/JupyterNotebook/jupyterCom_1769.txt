I would like `notebook.line_numbers` to use `ConfigWithDefaults` as well to keep these properties consistent. I tried it and the issue is this: `ConfigWithDefaults` (or `notebook.class_config.set`) saves the line numbers toggle state at `Notebook.Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers` and `ConfigSection` (or `notebook.config.update`) saves it at `Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers`. After switching to `ConfigWithDefaults`, the cells no longer reflected the state in `Notebook.Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers` after refresh. However, if I manually changed the value of `Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers` in `notebook.json`, then they would reflect that. **Sooo, the cells are not accessing the line numbers toggle state from `notebook.line_numbers` but appear to accessing it via `notebook.config.data.Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers`. My question for you: where does Codemirror look to determine whether a cell should display line numbers or not (specifically on load)?**\n2.

I tried it and the issue is this:\n>    ConfigWithDefaults (or notebook.class_config.set) saves the line\n>    numbers toggle state at Notebook.Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers and\n>    ConfigSection (or notebook.config.update) saves it at\n>    Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers. After switching to ConfigWithDefaults, the\n>    cells no longer reflected the state in Notebook.Cell.cm_config.\n>    lineNumbers after refresh. However, if I manually changed the value of\n>    Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers in notebook.json, then they would reflect\n>    that. _Sooo, the cells are not accessing the line numbers toggle state\n>    from notebook.line_numbers but appear to accessing it via\n>    notebook.config.data.Cell.cm_config.lineNumbers. My question for you: where\n>    does Codemirror look to determine whether a cell should display line\n>    numbers or not (specifically on load)?_\n> 2. Is there a better place to put the \"check nbconfig for\n>    header/toolbar toggle state and hide/show them accordingly\" behavior than\n>    in the initialization of the notebook class (like\n>    notebook.load_notebook for example)?\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1769#issuecomment-249010144,\n> or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAUez2t4sDZ71KaM56Al57PNjhchdlrxks5qstzogaJpZM4J_FhF\n> .\n",
