    "body": "Here are a couple of options:\n1. Queue up the pending cells at the notebook level and run them when the kernel is set. This doesn't prevent the cells from being modified before they are run, though.\n2. Make a fake \"kernel\" that just queues up execution requests, and set that to the cells when they are first created. This has the advantage that the cell logic identifying it's running, etc., still works as-is.\n3. Throw an error when trying to run a cell and a kernel is not active.\n\nI think a combination of (2) and (3) would work well.  The initial dummy kernel optimistically assumes there will eventually be a good connection, and just queues up execution requests.  However, if there is an error with the kernel, we throw an error to the user when trying to execute the cells.\n",
