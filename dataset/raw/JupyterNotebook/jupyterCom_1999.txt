    "body": "That would be super neat! I've wanted this as well. On a Windows surface (pro|book), it would be nice to be able to pop open an area to start drawing in a similar fashion to how we do in OneNote.\r\n\r\nUI wise, I'd love to be able to write directly into a new cell as a canvas area and save that as `image/png`. It's up to a notebook implementation to handle this as they see fit.\r\n\r\nAs for implementation, I think it would be nice if there was a generic yet specified field for mime bundles similar to `display_data` from outputs. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncell_type: \"mimebundle\",\r\ndata: {\r\n  \"image/png\": ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly I'm spitballing here. I know I opened a related issue for being able to put `text/html` on the page without requiring magics (for the benefit of other kernels than IPython). Basically, some way to flip between edit and view mode for a singular mimetype.",
