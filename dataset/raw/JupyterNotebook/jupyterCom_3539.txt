Was that necessary to get that in directory listing ? Or is the server doing a os.stat on every file when listing a directory ? If is is there might be a perf bottle neck we need to be careful there.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou seem to have 16 commits and a collaborator (good job to both of you for handling Git). Do you wish to reduce your commit number (rebase), to make history cleaner. \r\n\r\nFrom your screenshot I can see that some files are 2B and below, and actually fraction of a Bytes.... Are you sure this is right ? Is there not a factor of 1000 somewhere ? (feel free to use an [external library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-bytes), assuming it is small enough, the license is right... etc). )\r\n\r\nI'll do further inline comments.",
