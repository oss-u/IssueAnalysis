You need to look at the Javascript tests (see the links in the first message), pick a test and understand what it's doing. Then look at the Selenium tests (also linked in the first message), and understand how they work. Then translate the Javascript test you chose to Selenium.\r\n\r\nThis should get easier as we convert more of the tests, because there will be more examples to look at. @mpacer and I are working on converting some of them, so if you're not sure what to do, I can hopefully point you to an example pull request soon.",

And once your pull request is ready I can use it as a guide to make sure my code is consistent with yours and also in case I got stuck or something. \r\n\r\nBut before I do that I have a question, you would want all tests from the three directories you linked above in the same `tests/selenium` directory? or you want them separated as they are now? so that the selenium directory is something like:\r\n```\r\nselenium/base/\r\nselenium/notebook/\r\n```\r\nLet me know if it's okay to start tackling the `notebook` directory and what structure do you prefer inside the new `tests/selenium` directory and I can start working on immediately.",

That deals with starting a notebook server in a separate process, starting a Selenium driver, and navigating it to the files list of the notebook server. The Selenium driver is `authenticated_browser` inside the test code.\r\n\r\nThe first loop clicks down into directories in the list, until it reaches one with no subdirectories. At each level, it waits for something with the HTML class `item_link` to be visible on the page. Then it makes a list of such elements and stores it in a dictionary by the URL. If there's only one item, we assume that's `..` (go up a level); otherwise we get the second item, click it, and assert that the new URL is what the link pointed to.\r\n\r\nThe second loop goes back up the levels, using browser history. Again, at each step it waits for something with class `item_link`, then builds a list of those items, and checks it against the list of items it found on the page on the way in. Then it calls `authenticated_browser.back()` to go back a step in history.\r\n\r\nThis may not seem like much of a test, but we recently made it navigate directories without reloading the page, using the history API in Javascript, and there were a few bugs in that.",

However, it's somewhat blocked at the moment because @mpacer is working on some utilities for the test framework to interact with the notebook UI, and there was only one test for the file list, which was already converted.\r\n\r\nThe tests in the `base` and `security` directories mostly don't seem to use the DOM, so these could be converted to use a regular JS test framework like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and be run in Node without needing to control a browser. That should make them faster, and if there are failures they will probably be easier to debug.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could write new Selenium tests for parts of the UI other than the notebook editor - e.g. the 'running' tab in the dashboard, or authentication (visit `.../logout`, check that we can't get back to `.../tree`, try an invalid token, then the correct one).",
