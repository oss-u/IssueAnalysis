    "body": "Hi.  Full disclosure: I know hardly anything about the front-end of things, so please take this with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nDoes the comment in this file provide any hints: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/static/custom/custom.js\r\n\r\nTo me, it implies that the containers of the custom code are commonly named - `custom.js` and `custom.css`, although I'd agree with the implication that a custom directory should allow for any file in that directory to be available. Are you able to show the references that imply custom files other than `custom.js` and `custom.css` can be used?  Perhaps those references might provide some further hints.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that besides [`extra_static_paths` there is `static_custom_path`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/notebookapp.py#L1281-L1303) which might be what you want to use instead.\r\n\r\nThat said, I may be just causing more grief here, but I hope you might find this useful.",

I can configure the notebook server using the following `jupyter_notebook_config.py`: \r\n```python\r\nc.NotebookApp.extra_static_paths = [\r\n    \"/path/to/my/custom/stuff\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\nNow, if I visit `localhost:8888/static/test.js`, I can see my JS file as I'd expect. \r\n\r\nJust a couple of things to note: \r\n1) Static files are served behind the `/static` endpoint, e.g. `/static/test.js` in my example above.\r\n2) The full path you supply, e.g. `/path/to/my/custom/stuff`, is not included in the URL. \r\n\r\nAre you expecting something different?",

You are correct - the error was mine in that I was relying on the Chrome dev tools to inspect served static files, but for some reason they do not appear there. You can access the files by entering the URL manually as you suggested. Looks like I put too much faith in the console - lesson learned.\r\n\r\nThanks again.",
