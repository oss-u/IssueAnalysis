    "body": "Thank you for this update, @Amini-ML \r\n\r\nWith this change it seems to work most of the time if after restarting the jupyter server, the URL of the notebook is reloaded in the browser. There were a few instances where it was still stuck. I will test more with real notebooks.\r\n\r\nIf however I don't reload the URL in the browser, and restart the jupyter server, followed by kernel restart, it says the kernel has been restarted, but the notebook won't run, all cells are (*) busy. Probably it shouldn't say the kernel has been restarted if in fact it's not functional.\r\n\r\nFor other linux/chrome users who may read this, the config file is `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` and you will need jupyter-notebook >= 6.0.3 for this to work. (at least it didn't with 6.0.1) and of course, you will need to restart the jupyter server after changing the config file.",
