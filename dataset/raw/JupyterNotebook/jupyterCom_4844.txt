I'm using binder and my students with Android phones can open existing ipynb files on Jupyterlab with double tapping on file names however iPhone and iPad users cannot open a file after double tapping.\r\n\r\nSince you asked question about running cells in iPad, I was interested to know how you can open ipynb files in jupyterlab from your iPad. Since double tap does not work, how can my students open ipynb files in their own iPhone/iPad devices?\r\n\r\nI posted this question at jupyterhub/binderhub#970 and they referred to this repo.\r\n",

In this way, I can single tapping to open ipybn file. \r\nBut in the course, maybe have some problems when all students using single platform. So I have a not good suggestion: you can build docker, write some scripts to change port, and automatic run it... Until binderhub have a solution on your question.",
