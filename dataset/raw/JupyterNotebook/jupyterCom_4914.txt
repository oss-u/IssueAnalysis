    "body": "Hi @Surya1208, I can reproduce this issue if I remove the runtime directory _while_ notebook server is running.  Any subsequent attempts to start a kernel, within that server's instance, fail with the inability to write the connection file.  \r\n\r\nRestarting the Notebook server should recreate the appropriate runtime directory structure and kernel start requests should then be honored.\r\n\r\nIf you find the restart resolves your issue, could you please close this issue?  Otherwise, we'll need to continue looking into this.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
