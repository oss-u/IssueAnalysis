It seemed that when we put the untrusted symbol and text in the toolbar, it gets confused with either the kernel that is running or whether the document was autosaved or not.\n\nSeeing that \"trusted\" means that the user has run all of the cells in the document, we could either have this \"untrusted notification\" be only dismissable (no buttons, only clickable to dismiss) or let the user decide if they either want to dismiss it or trust it on the spot (action buttons that are similar to the dialogs that are being built in JupyterLab).\n\n## Untrust notification with action buttons (dismiss and trust)\n\n![buttons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6437976/14396998/b8a3cb0e-fd8f-11e5-836c-18e8e71f58a3.png)\n\n## Untrust notification with only dismiss on click\n\n![nobuttons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6437976/14397006/c1e0e184-fd8f-11e5-9bc0-1cb7a6e0d461.png)\n",

Isn't it a bit misleading?\n\nWe don't need to have only the icon clickable, the all notification can, so I would just remove the `i` in the circle, but we can try that later. \n\nAlso, dumb question, we already have a notification area, which is meant for notification, notification that can be sticky. Why not use it ?\n",
