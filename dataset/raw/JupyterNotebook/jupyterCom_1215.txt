There are a few ways to do this (rebase, reset).\n\nSince it looks like there are a few commits at the end you don't need, you can reset to the real changes with:\n\n```\ngit reset d120344 --hard\n```\n\nAnd then re-push, adding `-f` to allow rewriting history:\n\n```\ngit push -f # may need to specify origin and/pr branch, depending on your git situation\n```\n",
