    "body": "> An error loading an extension shouldn't prevent you from creating a new notebook. ðŸ˜•\r\n\r\nI fully agree with this. It looks to me as though you have the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator *serverextension* enabled in config (this is in server config rather than frontend js config files, where JavaScript nbextensions are enabled, which is why the edit hasn't fixed it for you), but you don't have the required python package installed. In situations like this, I would expect notebook server to log the failed import as an error, but continue loading anyway. Is this not the specified behaviour? At any rate, since the extension code isn't even present to load, it can't be at fault directly :/\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you should hopefully be able to just run \r\n\r\n    jupyter serverextension disable --sys-prefix jupyter_nbextensions_configurator\r\n\r\nI add the `--sys-prefix` flag since it's the default for anaconda installs, but you may also want/need to run the same using the `--user` or `--system` flag instead, depending on how you enabled it in the forest  place. Alternatively, you should be able to find the keys to manually remove in the `jupyter_notebook_config.json` (or `.py`) file(s) in one or more of the config paths in the output of `jupyter --paths`.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense?
