My event is a notebook-wide event for components to know when a cell clears its output - useful for something outside of the output area (and something that possibly doesn't have a handle on the output area).

Another distinction is that a single cell may have more than one output area - my event is per cell, and this is per output area.",

    "body": "@jasongrout Thanks for this! I did some experimenting and I think your `'clear_output.CodeCell'` suffices. It's more consistent with Min's recently added `'output_added.OutputArea'` event and since it no longer depends on a specific `output_area.element`, I can take it out of the `append` function and avoid duplicating event handlers.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// When an output is cleared,\r\noutput_area.events.on('clear_output.CodeCell', handleClearOutput);\r\n// When an output is added to the output area\r\noutput_area.events.on('output_added.OutputArea', handleAddOutput);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this and release 5.0.0rc!",
