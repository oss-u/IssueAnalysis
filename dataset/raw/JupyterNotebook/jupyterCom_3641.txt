    "body": "@takluyver Ok, just fyi after some discussions in the numpy issue: It kind of does seem to be related to IPython, at least the error doesn't happen in the regular python shell, only in IPython/Jupyter notebook. But it's probably still an anaconda/MLK issue. The simplest example to reproduce an error like this in regular Python is with the following code:\r\n```python\r\nimport IPython                   # or PyQt5.QtWidgets\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.random.randn(2)\r\nprint(a.dtype)                   # float64\r\nprint(np.linalg.norm(a))         # 7.523412005985283 or some other real number\r\nb = np.array(a, dtype=np.float32)\r\nprint(np.linalg.norm(b))         # nan / 0.0 / 6074001000.0 / 1.4142135 (i.e. not the right answer)\r\n```\r\nAnd in IPython the error happens without importing IPython first (as it is imported at startup).\r\nI really don't know what in the world importing another library would do to mess up numerical results like this, but yeah, I guess there is still not really anything that you can do about it...",
