To the best of my understanding, browsers should anyway protect themselves from code that could be embeded in svg images: SVG documents added to the page as images will have their JavaScript ignored.

Unless I am missing something, could this be reconsidered? and if I am missing something, may I suggest that reasons for excluding SVG are explicitly mentioned in the security.html document?",
