I didn't really understand the problem though since there's no error printed by Jupyter. But anyway, the initial reply can be received now after I followed your changes. So thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm now stuck at the message signature. I just can't get it work...can't even rebuild it using python...I might have a look at your code again to figure out. Even the spaces inside the serialised JSON strings will effect the encryption result...`\"{\"value\": \"key\"}\"` is different from `\"{\"value\":\"key\"}\"` where the former has a space there...There little things have driven me crazy...",
