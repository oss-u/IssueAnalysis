    "body": "Hi.  This issue stems from newer versions of [pyrsistent not working on Python 2.7](https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent/issues/207).  Since this is a transitive dependency (via [jsonschema](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema/issues/741)) there isn't a whole lot we can do.\r\n\r\nTo get around this immediate issue, you should be able to downgrade your pyrsistent package using the equivalent of `pip install pyrsistent==0.16.0`.  However, please keep in mind that Python 2.7 is no longer supported so you might find similar issues elsewhere and could run into pushback beyond these kinds of downgrade steps you're doing here.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as the downgrade of pyrsistent should get you moving forward.",
