    "body": "That's a difference between Legacy Python and Python 3. In Legacy Python, calling `range()` returns a list of numbers. In Python 3, it creates a `range` object, which is more efficient, and whose representation happens to look the same as your input. You can see this more clearly if you do:\n\n``` python\nstart = 3\nstop = 12\nrange(start, stop)\n```\n\nwhich will have the result\n\n``` python\nrange(3, 12)\n```\n\nIf you want to get the Legacy Python list in Python 3, you can pass the range to `list`:\n\n``` python\nlist(range(2, 5))\n[2, 3, 4]\n```\n",
