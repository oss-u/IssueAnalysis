The thing is that [the Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html#GitHub-flavored-markdown) says it \"supports Github flavored markdown\".  It says this only in the context of allowing triple-backtick code blocks, but I think the average person reading \"supports Github-flavored markdown\" is going to reasonably think that means it supports basically everything you can do with Markdown on Github, which would include emojis.  If that's not the case it might be better to adjust the documentation so it more narrowly says something like \"You can use triple backticks for code blocks (similar to Github)\" rather than broadly saying that Github-flavored markdown is supported.",
