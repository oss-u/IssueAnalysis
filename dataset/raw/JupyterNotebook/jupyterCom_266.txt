    "body": "Awesome, thanks for working on this!\n\nI am +1 on getting features to users quickly, but let's not break the\nmeaning of our versions to do that. With the notebook being a separate\npackage, we can just release its 5.0 version when we are happy with the new\nfeatures we have added.\n\nOn Sun, Aug 9, 2015 at 6:38 PM, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> From discussion the other day: we are thinking of accepting some new\n> features into 4.x releases, so that we can keep the user experience moving\n> forwards while people are working on refactoring all the frontend stuff.\n> \n> Multi-cell selection is perhaps the biggest thing that we've been wanting\n> to add for a long time, so I thought I'd take a crack at it. It turned out\n> not to be too bad (so far...).\n> \n> Use: shift+j/k to select a range of cells, shift+m to merge the selected\n> range. I haven't yet changed all the other actions which should now be able\n> to affect a range of cells, but doing so should be mostly straightforward.\n> \n> API: I've tried to keep existing API working, so stuff that assumes the\n> selection is a single cell will act on the cell at the cursor - the most\n> recently selected one. This makes some names a bit confusing - e.g.\n> Cell.unselect() now has a leave_selected parameter (to move the cursor\n> away without actually unselecting). The notebook has some very similarly\n> \n> ## named methods, like get_selected_cell() and get_selected_cells().\n> \n> You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266\n> Commit Summary\n> - First attempt at multi-cell selection\n> - Multi-cell selection based on a selection anchor cell\n> - Merge cells based on range selection\n> - Clear selected range on entering edit mode\n> \n> File Changes\n> - _M_ notebook/static/notebook/js/actions.js\n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266/files#diff-0 (36)\n> - _M_ notebook/static/notebook/js/cell.js\n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266/files#diff-1 (21)\n> - _M_ notebook/static/notebook/js/codecell.js\n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266/files#diff-2 (8)\n> - _M_ notebook/static/notebook/js/keyboardmanager.js\n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266/files#diff-3 (4)\n> - _M_ notebook/static/notebook/js/notebook.js\n>   https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266/files#diff-4 (209)\n> \n> Patch Links:\n> - https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266.patch\n> - https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266.diff\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/266.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

Adding something like\n\n```\n.cell.selected\n{\n    background-color: #f4f4f4;\n}\n```\n\nlooks much better IMO, but is probably still not optimal.\nAlso, I think `shift-up` and `shift-down` in command mode is more natural than `shift-j`and `shift-k` (where do they come from ?).\n\nConverted the copy and paste notebook extension, works nicely with the new multicell-selection.\n\nOn a side note: Always having to do a `python setup.py install` after changing a single line of Javascript code in Jupyter is painful. Luckily, I can do everything I want to do with extensions.\n",
