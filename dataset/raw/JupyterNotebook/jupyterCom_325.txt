This  would be very useful for single users like us in a lab who has a long-lived server instance and want to connect to it via a third-party client.\n\nby the way I finished my real-time collaborative jupiter client! Right now I am making some demo videos to explain what you can do with it, since the design is very different from coLab and jupyter so it needs some explanation to go with it.\n\nWould you be interested in testing it out?\n",
