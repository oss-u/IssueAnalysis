    "body": "@toanasahmed - we're actually going backwards here from a troubleshooting standpoint, so let's try to address the issues I see in your response and we'll go from there.\r\n\r\n1. The debug flag uses two dashes and no space between the second dash and the string 'debug'.  It is literally `--debug`.  The ellipses (e.g., `...`) were purely meant to represent the rest of **your** command line when `jupyter notebook` was started the first time.  They should not be included in your command and is why jupyter produced its help output because it couldn't parse those options.   If you don't know how your jupyter server was started originally, then it may not be possible to continue this exercise unless your original command was simply `jupyter notebook`.\r\n2. From the screen shot of your server console, I see you probably have two **previous** instances of jupyter server running.  The first is using port `8888`, the second is using port `8889` and the final (current) instance is listening on port `8890`.  I would strongly recommend you terminate all instances so that only one is running (with the `--debug` flag).  To terminate instances, go to their command window/terminal and enter `<control-C>` twice.  This will terminate a single instance of a server.  If you no longer have access to those terminals, you'll need to determine the notebook process and terminate it.\r\n3. Once you start a jupyter server with debug enabled, you'll need to attempt to use a kernel.  Its that attempted use of the kernel that should produce more information on the terminal window in which you started the server.  Its _that_ information that is desired.  From your output above, I just see an instance (likely the third instance) of notebook server started successfully, but because you didn't attempt to start a kernel, I can't help with the original issue.\r\n\r\nOnce the these three points are addressed I think we should be able to move forward on troubleshooting your original issue.  Thanks.",

I'm not sure how to go about troubleshooting them, but its clear the launched kernel is not responding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else has ideas?  I'm copying a few others that I've seen on threads dealing with conda kernels - hopefully they'll have some ideas or provide links to previous solutions.  @takluyver @blink1073 @Carreau \r\n\r\nOne thing you might try is re-installing nb-conda-kernels and/or creating another env.  I don't know what the scope of nb-conda-kernels is - whether they span all conda envs or are specific to a particular env - but if you can uninstall them, you could try [installing ipykernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/index.html#installation) and use that from Notebook.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not being able to help you further.\r\n",
