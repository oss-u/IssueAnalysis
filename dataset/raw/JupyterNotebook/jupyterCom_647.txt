See pythontutor.com to visualize the steps that the code example is executing.\n\nThe difference in output that you are seeing when using the python console vs. ipython has to do with what is being displayed to the user. There is no difference in the underlying calculation.\n\ncc/@carreau Please tag as not a bug. It may be worthwhile updating the IPython documentation to clarify as a wishlist item.\n",

    "body": "Tagging as wishlist. \n\nMore especially, IPython will consider the return value of the ast expression of the Abstract Syntax Tree as the output value for current cell. In a notebook it might be difficult to see but in a pure IPython shell you can see the difference between printing and returning:\n\n```\nIn [1]: 1\nOut[1]: 1\n\nIn [2]: print(1)\n1\n```\n\nIn the second case you do not get a `Out[ ]`.\n\nIIRC the distinction is on purpose as Python repl does not allow multiple statement:\n\n```\n>>> for i in range(5):\n...     i\n... 1\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 3\n    1\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nwhile IPython does:\n\n```\nIn [1]: for i in range(5):\n   ...:     i\n   ...: 1\n   ...:\nOut[1]: 1\n```\n\nAnd doing same behavior than Python repl too often flood the screnn.\n\nAs you are using python 3 and generator be aware that `range()` is already a generator [technically more that that but not the goal here]. So your `(x for x in range(5))` is basically reimplementing range :-). Though it is a nice start to work with generator !\n\nHave fun with it, and feel free to ask more question. \n\nMarking as wishlist to improve our documentation !\n",
