You can think of `define()` as the lazy of the two. It tells you that something does exist and will evaluate it when needed. This is generally useful when you have circular dependencies. \n\nIt took me a while to understand it as well. It's kinda weird !\n\nThanks for try though ! We really appreciate !\n",
