Check the port number to insert in the browser --> 8000 (or 8001) instead of 8888 which is indicated by the command line.\r\n\r\nFrom these actions, I think checking the _caching_ by the browser was the most crucial.\r\n\r\nGood luck",

We spend lots of time and work to make things as easy as possible while still secure, and it personally hurt when I spent a week implementing the new screen to simplify setting password without having to reach for the command line. We unfortunately don't have access to infinite resources, and sometime we miss edge cases. We would be happy to work with you to figure out why it did not work for you, and how to make sure it does not affect other people. \r\n\r\nI would suggest and read about DNS rebinding: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1447\r\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/bittorrent-users-beware-flaw-lets-hackers-control-your-computer/\r\n\r\nWithout token or password, you would be vulnerable to local code execution on your machine by just visiting a website.\r\n\r\nIf you want even more convenience, I would suggest also trying https://nteract.io/, which is a native electron app that can open and run Jupyter notebooks.
