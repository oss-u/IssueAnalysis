MathJax expects that you will use standard HTML tags to handle formatting the text of your page; it only handles the mathematics. So, for example, MathJax does not implement `\\emph` or `\\begin{enumerate}...\\end{enumerate}` or other text-mode macros or environments.\r\n\r\nThen, I presume, this issue is invalid and may be closed.",
