E.g. you can rename a kernel in your user kernel dir to `dev~34` and it can be started (http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Untitled8.ipynb?kernel_name=dev~34) and it works (kernel executes python code), but the logo is not visible. \n\nIMO the [regex for kernel specs](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/kernelspecs/handlers.py#L82) should be reworked to accept all chars except `/` if that's what other parts of the notebook accept as a kernel name.\n\nAlso, the part which starts a kernel and lists all kernels should prevent kernels with unsuitable names and not list them (e.g. I can start kernels with `/` in the name, the only problem is the logo and a not visible parsing error in the UI due to some misnamed IDs, but python code executes).\n",

It doesn't look like that got translated into docs or code, though.\n\nThe current regex will match any Unicode word character on Python 3, as well as `_-/.`. I think we should make that more specific to ascii characters (`[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]`), to avoid any potential confusion relating to filesystem encoding.

You can revert to the normal implementation by uninstalling conda_nb_kernels\n\nJust to make it clear, the default jupyter notebook experience does not come with this extensions, these extension is something that Anaconda ships by default. You can uninstall the extensions or create a new environment just with the notebook package to have the naive/normal experience.\n\nFinally, as @takluyver mentioned, the logo issue should not be a problem, and we will fix it soon.\n",
