If you have done `pip install --upgrade ipython`, that should install a newer IPython in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`. `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` being on the front of sys.path means that there is an `easy-install.pth` file with this path, which should be removed. It is caused by a bug in setuptools. The most likely location for this file is:\n\n```\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth\n```\n\nYou can check for this setuptools bug with:\n\n```\ngrep dist-packages /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/*.pth\n```\n\nIf the file is where I expect it is, the fix should be to remove the file:\n\n```\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth\n```\n\nWhile you are at it, make sure your pip/setuptools are up to date:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade setuptools pip\n```\n",
