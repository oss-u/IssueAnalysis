Apparently [according to this JupyterLab issue 3984](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3984) it _may_ be due to out of date jupyterlab extension. I am going to recommend to my coworker to try updating as the issue comments suggest.\r\n\r\nAlso related to this [Jupyter lab google group posting](https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/86P4KQSZ0HU). Seems like updating is the recommendation.",
