Libzmq shouldn't matter - if pyzmq doesn't find it on the system, it will build a bundled copy, I believe. But the Python header files are needed.\n\nAnaconda has precompiled packages on Linux, whereas pip needs to compile things like pyzmq from source, so if you do decide to install Anaconda, you should avoid this issue.\n\nClosing as, if that is indeed the problem, I don't think we can do anything about it.\n",
