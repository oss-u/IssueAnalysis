What about `Cmd-Shift-[`? Would that be ok? What about`Cmd-\\`?",

    "body": "The typical reasonig for shortcut is the following:\r\n\r\nNo shortcut should use Alt (or Shift but in a lesser measure) by default. None. Ever. \r\n\r\nMany non-english keyboard need Alt and or Shift to type characters. So Shift and Alt are not available.\r\n\r\nTypically, french keyboard use Shift for Numbers. So `Cmd-Shift-[` is actually \"`Cmd-5`\" on a french keyboard... which is taken, and on French keyboard typing `[` actually require pressing `Alt-Shift-5`... so I'm not even sure how that will conflict resolve, or if this could trigger ghost shortcuts.\r\n\r\nHence I would prefer _not_ to do it. What we can (and maybe should) do, is provide a set of \"nice but not enabled by default\" keymap that are a click away, and provide a \"Querty-layout\" extra, \"Azerty layout extra\", \"Cyrillic extra\", where we can go as crazy as we like. \r\n",
