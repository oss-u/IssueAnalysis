    "body": "@slagtermaarten Hi, I'm not sure if you're still looking for a solution here. One thing I've tried is some jQuery in the custom.js folder.  Per this documentation, that should be located in the following folder:\r\n\r\n`~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js`\r\n\r\nOn Windows, that is something like:\r\n\r\n`C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\.jupyter\\custom\\custom.js`\r\n\r\nFor my purposes, I wanted to sort by last modified descending (newest to oldest).  For that, I added a function to delay *clicking* the Last Modified button by ~1 second after the DOM finishes loading.  You can adjust that if your system is faster/slower at loading things.  The sort is retained for the session.\r\n\r\nAnyway, at the bottom of the custom.js file, I added the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$(function(){\r\n  function change_order(){\r\n    $(\"#last-modified\").click(); // Click to sort ascending \r\n    $(\"#last-modified\").click(); // Click again to sort descending\r\n  };\r\n  window.setTimeout( change_order, 1000 ); // 1 second delay after DOM ready\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nClicking the button twice results in sorting by newest and the button looks like the following:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25012707/82579038-39118480-9b5b-11ea-936d-631eec770028.png)\r\n\r\nThe IDs are found if you right-click on your button and select 'inspect element'.  If you know some HTML, the id tag should be easy to find.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",
