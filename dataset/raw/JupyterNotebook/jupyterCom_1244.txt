    "body": "For now, I think the toolbar would be the appropriate place for this in the\ncurrent notebook.\n\nBeyond that, I am going to start having @cameronoelsen start to work on\nsome new UI ideas for cells that address better output collapse/scroll,\ninput hiding/show, etc. I think per cell actions like this should be more\nclosely associated with cells - rather than up on the toolbar. The main\nquestion is how to represent that UI without putting the same UI on every\ncell - that would be too much repetition. I have some ideas, but will need\nto work with Cameron on them from the visual/interaction perspective.

The short cut I need looks to be in continuation of the `Edit Mode (press Enter to enable)` paragraph, this is why I was confused. Shift is because it shows a capital `L`. I see there is no Cmd (it belonged to the upper 'save and checkpoint'). \n",
