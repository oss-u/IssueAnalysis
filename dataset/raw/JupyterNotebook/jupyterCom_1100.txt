    "body": "Thanks! Looks like the test is failing for real. Can you investigate that?\n\nI believe this change isn't quite the right fix, because it enables clobbering any existing file if the case doesn't match (on a case-insensitive filesystem). In order to fix #911 more precisely, I think the check needs to be for whether the destination name in the case of a collision actually refers to the same file as the original. Something like:\n\n``` python\nif exists(destination):\n    if destination really is origin:\n        proceed\n    else:\n        raise 409\n```\n\nThe really-is-origin check can probably use `os.stat`:\n\n``` python\n# assume we have already verified that a and b both exist\nis_same_file = (os.stat(a).st_ino == os.stat(b).st_ino)\n```\n\nto verify that the two paths actually refer to the same file.\n",
