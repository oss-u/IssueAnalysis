Also, it's not just documentation, but our replies to questions on Github, mailing lists, real time chat, and so on. Writing \"edit your config in `~/.jupyter`\" is massively more convenient both for the people who have to write that and the people who read it and follow it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make it comply with XDG specs on your own systems, you can set `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jupyter`.\r\n\r\n> And unless the config directory on Windows is ~/.jupyter as well...\r\n\r\nIt is.

We're readily expecting things like:\r\n- https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory\r\n- http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files\r\n- https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/UserProfile\r\n- http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Customize-Files.html\r\n- ... many others, these are just some programs I have used today\r\n\r\nFor your target audience, the introduced \"unclarity\" is non-existent.\r\n\r\n> [...] but our replies to questions on Github, mailing lists, real time chat [...]\r\n\r\nThis is a narrowly constructed argument. If your observation is a non-zero gain in streamlining of the help process, I'll take your word for it. But I did support for several cross platform software packages and the \"massively more convenient\" in the given context is hardly believable.\r\nNot meaning to offend: this sounds lazy.\r\nAnd then that would be a really strong point in favour of the Desktop/jupyter-config suggestion (hope I got a chuckle with that, if nothing else).\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Its about the **benefits** of this particular one: uncluttered `$HOME`, easier to backup (and version-control), separation between settings, permanent data and cache. Those are concrete, tangible benefits, and the real reason people are asking software to follow the standard.\r\n\r\nAs for 2... what exactly is \"_consistent location across platforms_\"? Different platforms have different filesystem hierarchy already! Program data, settings, cache are in completely different locations on Windows, Linux and Mac. Even the user's home folders are in _very_ distinct locations. Users know that and it was never a big deal. Platforms also have different env vars to match such special dirs: Windows have `%APP_DATA%` and the like, Linux have `$XDG_*`, what's the problem?\r\n\r\nJust because all those platforms happen to share an env var named `HOME` it does not mean that location is suitable for tossing settings and data.",
