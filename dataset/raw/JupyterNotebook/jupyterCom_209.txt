In my mind, \"customizing\" is about taking already-existing systems and changing the parameters to them (e.g. changing how many lines are retained in history, or changing the prompt in the terminal), whereas \"extending\" has more of a connotation of adding entirely new systems (e.g. the notebook sharing system on Quantopian).  Something like writing a new contents manager falls on the border of these two ideas.\n\nI also refer to \"overriding\" aspects of the notebook a few times here, which probably could be better-phrased as \"customizing\".\n",
