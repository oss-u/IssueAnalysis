    "body": "This is probably pushing my understanding of python envs, but I suspect the kernelspec that is trying to be used is pointing at the deleted python (assuming `/anaconda3/envs/py37/bin/python` was the deleted env).\r\n\r\nTry running `jupyter kernelspec list`.  This will produce a list of kernel/directory pairs.  Unfortunately, the kernel named in this list is not the \"display name\" used when you select the kernel in Notebook/Lab, but I'm hoping you can narrow things down.\r\n\r\nOf the candidate entries, open the `<directory>/kernel.json` file.  In the first entry of the `argv` stanza is the path to the python executable.  I suspect you'll find `/opt/anaconda3/envs/notebook-dev/share/jupyter/kernels/python3` when you probably want the python bin from `/Users/colbyostberg/anaconda3`.",
