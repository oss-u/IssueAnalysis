IMHO:\n1. separate in memory representation of notebook from **on disk**. \n2. have the server keep an in memory version that have more temporary informations that the on disk one. Like a map from kernel messages to cells. \n3. refactor the js to no t register callbacks, but a mapping that in (2)\n4. design a API that store/load this mapping from the js to the server. \n\nThat would allow **some** messages to still work after page reload. \nMore complex things like messages that arrives while the browser is closed might not be able to be persisted. \n",

If a result arrives while a subscriber is not subscribed, then there is no chance to get. So in the case of:\r\n\r\n   - execute `sleep 5, print('hey')`\r\n   - close tab\r\n   - hey is \"printed\" nowhere\r\n   - reopen tab. \r\n\r\nThe \"hey\" is gone. \r\n\r\nThe second thing is that when you press shift-enter the callback that \"listen\" for the reply in in the Javascript context, somewhere we have no control over. When you refresh the page, the context is gone. We can't do anything about it. The you can reconnect, but some messages will have no remaining handler. So result don't display cause they don't know where to go.\r\n\r\nYou have to remember that current notebook is based on the websocket architecture with first version released on 2012,  using websockets. Websockets have been standardized in 2011 ( ! ), and notebook was brewing  for a few month (also we are python programmers, and the team was ~ 6 peoples including 3 in their PhD...), so we made non optimal decisions in the long term, but we kind of couldn't imagine what the future would be, and what would be available. \r\n\r\nSome of the solutions to these problems are easy to handwave, but require much more bandwidth than we have, and are harder to get right that it appears at first, especially without breaking APIs.\r\n\r\nIf some of you want to give it a try, even just small steps toward the solution, they we'll be happy to show you some of the changes that are necessary and key pieces to implement to make the behavior maybe not perfect; but at least much better. \r\n",

That is, the lack of buffering is something that we can fairly easily handle in user code (of course, it would still be nicer if we didn't have to, but it's just not that important).\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost problem is that when connecting to the notebook server with a new browser, the new browser never gets any updates. So even if the display is refreshed and/or new output appears, it still doesn't show up.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the notebook server simply doesn't send output to all browser, but only to the one that actually originally executed the cell.

It is incredibly useful for me!\r\n\r\nAs I have a setup where Jupyter runs on one computer and I connect from another and I have long-running jobs, I hacked a very much *quick and dirty* reconnect and replay proof of concept.\r\n\r\nIt is not really good enough, but it felt wrong not to share it just in case someone needs it something like it badly enough to cope with it. So here it is:\r\nhttps://github.com/t-vi/notebook/tree/replay\r\n\r\nIf I did not believe it before, this clearly showed to me that something along the lines of @Carreau's list above is needed for an actual solution, but maybe this is useful until a more appropriate solution is available.\r\nThe hack does replay instead of keeping the form of the notebook as Carreau suggested. This keeps everything on the browser side but probably isn't half as good as a solution.\r\nOn top of not being designed properly it is implemented in a very messy way, so you really want to use something else if you can.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nThomas\r\n",
