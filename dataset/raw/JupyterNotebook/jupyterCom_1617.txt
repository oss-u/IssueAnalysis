It's very easy to forget.\n\nWe've been trying to do that in our `nglview` package: https://github.com/arose/nglview/blob/ipywidgets5/nglview/__init__.py#L3-L10\n\nhttps://github.com/arose/nglview/blob/ipywidgets5/nglview/install.py\n\nThe Jupyter ecosystem is growing quite fast so it's understandable that the installation and API are not stable. Just want to bring the issue here for discussion.\n\nHai\n",
