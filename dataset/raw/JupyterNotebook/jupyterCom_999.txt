It's just that thr index script (I think) gets stuck during trying of indexing 550'000 mostly png files (I estimate that that would happen with every type of file). I would include a methode before indexing, that goves back an error of to much files if a folder has more than x files. Or something like this. \n",

Even reading all this data into a 1.7gb big array in a iPython Notebook works without problem (is just slow). The thing that is actually more interesting is: It only crashes in Iceweasle. Clearly. Every other access after that is not working anymore on any browser. But I can access all those directories  without a problem, except a longer response time for once after that on Chrome or Safari before the crash with Iceweasle. \n",
