(Actually the notebook does not render LaTeX itemize or enumerate lists). \r\n\r\nThis was  implemented in the `latex_envs` nbextension, but I focused on a way to tackle nested environments of the same kind but forget that a given environment can include several environments of the same type at a given level; that is exactly the case you pointed above. This is corrected in the version on the repo and on pypi. ",
