    "body": "Hi, wanted to mention this as I was experiencing the same problem mentioned above on Chrome in Windows 10, and found this when searching around.\r\n\r\nOddly, the follow **does** work for me: if I highlight multiple cells (using shift+arrow keys), and then do ctrl+c or ctrl+x, it will copy the contents of the highlighted cells, then I can go to another notebook and paste them with ctrl+v. Neither c or x will delete the cells in the original notebook, just copy. But it works! Does not work with only a single cell highlighted.\r\n\r\nHope this might help someone.\r\n\r\n(my notebook server is running in a docker container that is running linux, but I'm accessing it in Chrome on Windows outside the container. When I run the versions command in a cell, I get the following)\r\n```\r\n!jupyter --version\r\n\r\njupyter core     : 4.6.3\r\njupyter-notebook : 6.0.3\r\nqtconsole        : not installed\r\nipython          : 7.13.0\r\nipykernel        : 5.3.0\r\njupyter client   : 6.1.3\r\njupyter lab      : 1.2.14\r\nnbconvert        : 5.6.1\r\nipywidgets       : not installed\r\nnbformat         : 5.0.7\r\ntraitlets        : 4.3.3\r\n```",
