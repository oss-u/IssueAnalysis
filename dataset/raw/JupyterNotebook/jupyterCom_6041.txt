    "body": "Hi @flupke. I think this pull request is probably better suited for [`jupyter_server`](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server) at this point for the following reasons...\r\n1. It constitutes new functionality which we're trying not to include in Notebook at this time\r\n2. Enterprise Gateway is now (master branch) based on jupyter_server for all future releases\r\n3. I think we should try to continue supporting 3.6 in this project for as long as possible and there may be a better argument for dropping 3.6 in jupyter server \r\n\r\nYou should find the source bases extremely similar (although the test frameworks vary quite a bit).\r\n\r\nAs for where to apply test code, and assuming I'm understanding the change, you could probably take a look at the [API kernels tests](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/d3b40f46654d9666a2ec5ba18b7133b0eb8a1820/jupyter_server/tests/services/kernels/test_api.py#L55) and not await the kernel start request and immediately follow it with one of these requests.",
