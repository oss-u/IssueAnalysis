    "body": "Thanks for the heads up. I looked into the code and found the mistake, which is indeed numba related, for anyone that may be interested. The 'pascal' function has a standard 'array out of bounds' error (the out array is (time+sectors) x (time+sectors) in size, but I try to assign to out[x][y] where x goes up to (time+sectors)). This gets caught normally in python, but when I wrap it in a numba jit it gets suppressed and briefly works, crashing if I run the snippet a second time.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the moral of the story is to make sure that python code has no errors before attempting to jit it.",
