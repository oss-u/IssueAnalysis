But when the file is also system file at same time, it probably should be taken into account, right? At least this comparision against 0x02 seems to return 0 for files which has both system and hidden attributes.\n\nLike this:\n\n``` python\n_win32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN = 0x02 | 0x04 # 0x04 means system file\n# ...\nif attrs > 0 and attrs & _win32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN:\n# ...\n```\n",
