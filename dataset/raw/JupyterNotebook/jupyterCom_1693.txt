If you are working off of the stable version, could you check that it works using the nbconvert master?\n\nAdditionally, could you see if this occurs if you use a more limited set of html markup? I.e., if it is a problem with a particular feature that is causing the entire conversion pipeline to burst rather than something general, it will save a lot of time to know which feature is causing that. \n",
