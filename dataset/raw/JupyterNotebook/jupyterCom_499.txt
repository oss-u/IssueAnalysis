The only way I've managed to deal with that is by checking if `.dataTable` is defined, and rescheduling the call if not (essentially polling for the plugin to be loaded).\n\n``` python\n# DataTable class modified from \n# http://blog.dornea.nu/2014/08/28/using-jquery-datatables-with-ipython/\n\nimport uuid\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\ndef DataTable(df):\n    \"\"\"Display a pandas.DataFrame as jQuery DataTables\"\"\"\n    # Generate random container name\n    id_container = uuid.uuid1()\n    output = \"\"\"\n<div id=\"datatable-container-{id_container}\">\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.datatables.net/u/dt/dt-1.10.12/datatables.min.css\"/>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.datatables.net/u/dt/dt-1.10.12/datatables.min.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function () {{\n      var dt = 100;\n      function tablify() {{\n        if ( $().dataTable === undefined ) {{\n          console.log(\"no dataTable\");\n          dt = dt * 1.5; // slow-down checks for datatable as time goes on;\n          setTimeout(tablify, dt);\n          return;\n        }}\n      $('#datatable-container-{id_container} table.datatable').dataTable();\n      }}\n      $(document).ready(tablify)\n      // tablify();\n    }})();\n  </script>\n  <!-- Insert table below -->\n  {table}\n</div>\n    \"\"\".format(\n        id_container=id_container,\n        table=df.to_html(index=False, classes=\"datatable dataframe\"))\n    return HTML(output)\n```\n\nBizarrely, that only works in the notebook, and the plugin is never loaded on nbviewer, which makes absolutely zero sense to me, because I can prove the javascript is loaded, it just doesn't register the plugin with jQuery for some reason that I don't understand.\n",

The last thing that I think was progress was https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/499#issuecomment-226438643 , where it looks to me like @minrk put in a fair amount of effort and couldn't figure out how to make it work consistently...?\r\n\r\nI think the suggestion of https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/499#issuecomment-231628579 *nominally* works, but I think we can all agree that's a hack, and there *should* be a better way to do it.\r\n\r\nAll that said, it may be that the real answer is \"this just isn't possible because javascript is cruel and unreasonable\".  If that's the case, I suppose this can be closed as \"won't fix\" or similar, but that's probably a command decision someone like @minrk or @ellisonbg  should make?",
