    "body": "Hi Erik - I completely agree about configuration system that is provided by traitlets being a bit mysterious.\r\n\r\nI think the correct approach here is for `SingleUserNotebookApp` to override the default values for a few of the referenced traitlets (and probably `allow_remote_access`?) - which appears to be your original intent.\r\n\r\nThe configurable classes have built into them knowledge about the class hierarchy - such that the \"configuration point\" for derived classes is the class themselves (e.g., SingleUserNotebookApp) even though the configurable option originates on a superclass.  This is evident when you run `jupyter-singleuser --help-all`.  This will display all of the configurable traits and their associated classes (or, what I referred to previously as \"configuration points\" - for lack of a better term).  \r\n\r\nWhat you'll also notice relative to `--SingleUserNotebookApp` is that none of the traitlets whose default values were manually overridden appear as configurable options in that output.  This is because the override of `open_browser = False` probably overrode the traitlet itself.  As a result, attempts to reference that as a configurable item result in the warning message.  (At least that's my suspicion.)\r\n\r\nFor a derived class to override an inherited configurable option, its built-in \"default\" function is required.  You can see this in [`JupyterApp` where it adjusts the default for `log_level`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/blob/master/jupyter_core/application.py#L70-L71) from its inherited value (`WARN`) to its desired value (`INFO`).  Likewise, I _could_ change NotebookApp's default `log_level` to `DEBUG` by implementing:\r\n```python\r\n    @default('log_level')\r\n    def _default_log_level(self):\r\n        return logging.DEBUG\r\n```\r\nNote: it's not clear to me when/if the `@default` decorator is necessary since `JupyterApp` doesn't use such a thing to change log level from `WARN` to `INFO`.  Hmm, it might be something as simple as appending `_default` to the function name while prepending it with `_` to eliminate the need for the decorator.  Boy, that's traitlets for you! :smile:\r\n\r\nSo, I think what should happen here is for `SingleUserNotebookApp` to add default methods for each of the inherited configurable options it wants to override.  I'm hoping that will eliminate the warning and restore the ability to use those options in a configurable manner.",

I'll use these insights as a foundation to figure out what I think makes sense which I'm not sure about yet.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this PR is an itchy feeling of seeing the JupyterHub logged warning about open_browser for two-three years. I bet many others have considered if that is the cause of some issue, so I figure it would be good to remove that distraction.",
