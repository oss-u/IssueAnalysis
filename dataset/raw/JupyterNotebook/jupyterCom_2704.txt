We discussed making it single JSON array then, but I was lazy (and apparently just dumping the whole list as JSON didn't occur to me :confused: ).\r\n\r\nI think we should make this behaviour a new option, and then maybe go through a deprecation cycle with `--json`. Even if we think no-one is using the old behaviour, we can't be sure, and I think we should take backwards compatibility a bit more seriously than we do.",
