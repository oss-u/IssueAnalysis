In an attempt to get it working, I changed the configuration to run behind a Nginx web server on the same EC2 instance, and got the I/O error that was discussed in the link above. \n\nOnce I disabled the progress bar, _both_ notebook configurations work.\n\nMy tornado version is from an anaconda 2.7 python build showing: tornado  4.3  py27_0    defaults\n\nRegarding the local CPU issue.  When the progress bar is disabled on that 'model.fit' function, the local CPU is not affected.  However, in the Nginx + Jupyter configuration, the local CPU is not bothered with or without the progress bar disabled.\n\nIf anyone is interested in how I set-up the Nginx + Jupyter configuration on the EC2 instance, let me know.\n\nThanks again for addressing my issue!\n",
