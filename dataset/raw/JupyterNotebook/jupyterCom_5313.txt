    "body": "Hi @lazywhite.  You probably want to take a look at the [jupyter_client API](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/manager.html), specifically the KernelManager class's [`start_kernel()`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/blob/master/jupyter_client/manager.py#L289) method.  This method will call `launch_kernel` to perform kernel launches, which returns a Popen instance against which the kernel lifecycle can be managed.  Communication with the kernel would then occur via an instance of `KernelClient` - all in the same package.",
