I have not tried prior releases of Notebook, but suspect this may be something environmental.\r\n\r\nIs the image rendered at all and could you please provide what the DevTools console message is?  Perhaps someone will have ideas based on that information.\r\n\r\nI do see this message in my tools/console window, but the image is rendered correctly:\r\n```\r\nDevTools failed to load SourceMap: Could not parse content for http://localhost:8888/nbconvert/html/style.min.css.map: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0\r\n```",
