    "body": "Hi Sylvain - thanks for submitting this pull request.  Using these changes, I am unable to complete a general restart of the kernel.  The state stays at `restarting` and no commands can be performed.  It does appear that the kernel manager is completing its restart of the process, but the setup of the kernel messaging is having issues.\r\n\r\nI also notice that `SIGINT` (multiple times) is not terminating the application (`SIGQUIT` does) implying that the process is probably tied up in lower levels.\r\n\r\nI've left a similar comment on the jupyter-server PR as well (once the method name is changed).",
