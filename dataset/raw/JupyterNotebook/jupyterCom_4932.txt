In the meantime, you can follow the work around instructions that @snapo left at the bottom of #4097 or downgrade jupyter_client to 5.3.1.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\ncc: @MSeal ",

    "body": "@Dhanesh37 - could it be the case that when you created the virtual environment, some updated versions of libraries were installed?  There has been some recent churn in this area.  Please try to compare the two environments (working, failing) and pay close attention to the versions of `jupyter_client` and `pywin32` in particular.  I suspect the originally working environment is using `jupyter_client <= 5.3.1` while the problematic env has `jupyter_client == 5.3.3`.\r\n\r\nShould we find both envs are using `jupyter_client == 5.3.3` and the only difference is the python version, then that may be a good hint in what has become a \"perfect storm\" of library updates. :smile:",
