    "body": "Relative to Notebook at least, handlers for a given \"service\" are typically located in that service's `handlers.py` file.  The contents service's handlers are defined in [notebook/services/contents/handlers.py](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/contents/handlers.py.).\r\n\r\nSomewhere, projects need to map a given endpoint to a handler class. For Notebook, [this location is typically at the bottom of the handlers.py files](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/contents/handlers.py#L320-L327).\r\n\r\nIt looks like the download handler you're looking for is \"listening\" on endpoint `/api/contents<path>`, where path is a Unix-style path starting with forward-slash ('`/`').  I believe the path portion is relative to the root directory (or notebook-dir) specified when Notebook was launched (or in its configuration file).\r\n\r\nSo, to access the file you reference and assuming the root directory is the actual root ('`/'`), your file could be downloaded using...\r\n\r\n`GET /api/contents/user/tom/files/bbb/Test.java`\r\n\r\nand that request would be handled by [`ContentsHandler`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/contents/handlers.py#L67).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.",
