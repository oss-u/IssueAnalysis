    "body": "@Carreau Thanks for the review and comments. I'll try to give some perspective inline on what my thinking was for inclusion. We can certainly iterate from there :-)\n\n> I would trim this list down a lot (personal opinion) :\n\nI would too. Yet, the growth of repos has made it difficult (particularly for a user of the projects) to see the breadth of projects that they may run across in their use of Jupyter. We do have this [subprojects](https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/subprojects.html) page in the Jupyter docs (which is different than the Jupyter notebook docs). The list of projects essentially come from that page. The additions are the docker repos and IPython/traitlets.\n\n>    3 docker-\\* repos (not really active)\n>    Notebook legacy docs are too much indexed by google, remove the link.\n>    IPython-\\* are IPython specific, I'm not sure we want the here.\n\nThe inclusion of these were prompted by an issue that @fperez filed https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/issues/87 after reading a blog post by G. Dumpleton on OpenShift, Docker, IPython and Jupyter. A [second blog post](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2015/12/random-user-ids-when-running-docker.html) came out yesterday.\n\n>    Traitlets maybe too much too.\n\nNo strong objections from me on removing.\n\n>    tmpnb is really unlikely to be useful.\n\nYou are likely correct, but I think that users have a name association with tmpnb so I don't think there is real harm of leaving it in.\n\n> I'm wondering if there is a way to but that in a package, and require it in all docs instead of having to update in N places.\n\nAgreed. I am pretty confident that a custom Sphinx theme based off the RTD theme will enable us to do this. \n\n:evergreen_tree: Ultimately, I would love to see a pretty docs landing page at Jupyter.org that visually displays the projects and links easily to the individual documentation. That would take longer to implement since it would need design work, strategic input on which projects, and development. I was hoping to implement this PR in jupyter/notebook and jupyter/jupyter docs as an interim step to at least give us the opportunity to begin referring to the front page of each of those docs as a gateway to most of the docs. It truly is an interim step but one that I think has benefits in the short term, especially since there will be eyeballs on both sets of docs when 4.1 is officially released :-)\n\nI'm open to thoughts and other ideas for now or down the road. :bulb: \n\ncc/ @ellisonbg \n",

    "body": "@fperez Agreed. Good suggestion re: border transition. I think we're on the same page re: priorities.\n\nWhen I say theme, I'm less focused on design (since that's not my strength) and more on content/structure. Things like:\n- simpler access to installation instructions for operating systems (see Astropy example)\n- easy access to the breadth of documentation/project links (see Django example)\n- Easy download of PDFs of documentation by project and/or versions and access to further help (see SciPy example)\n- Prominent access to notebook viewer (one of the most powerful features of the IPython documentation from a user group perspective) and examples (notebook gallery) (see IPython example)\n\n## Plan\n1. ASAP Highest priority - Have at least one location where all documentation can be accessed easily. This will likely be interim in terms of design but important to have as a start toward integrating the docs that live in different repos yet the user may wish to access easily while setting up their environment and workflows.\n2. come up ASAP with a standard `conf.py` (sidebars, links) and `index.rst` (consistent table of contents structure for a project) templates for existing and new documentation on RTD (These two files are what I'm referring to as a standard Jupyter theme or more simply Jupyter doc standard.)\n3. Revisit ipynb examples and use of `pandoc` or other third party Sphinx extensions to better display rendered notebooks on RTD.\n4. Add cross reference links to help end users navigate between common configuration scenarios that span multiple projects (i.e. jupyterhub, nbgrader) or (docker, notebook).\n\n@fperez, @ellisonbg Please let me know if you have different priorities.

I think we're on the same page re: priorities.\n> \n> When I say theme, I'm less focused on design (since that's not my\n> strength) and more on content/structure. Things like:\n> - simpler access to installation instructions for operating systems\n>   (see Astropy example)\n> - easy access to the breadth of documentation/project links (see\n>   Django example)\n> \n> Agreed.\n> - Easy download of PDFs of documentation by project and/or versions\n>   and access to further help (see SciPy example)\n> \n> While very valuable long-term, I'd put below the others in priority for\n> now, unless our build chain is in such good shape that it doesn't take much\n> work. I think for now, having good HTML docs is the main priority.  Someone\n> from the community could help with the technical tooling for clean PDF\n> builds, but I'd much rather your talents go towards thinking about content\n> and structure to help the users navigate their way around the project.\n> - Prominent access to notebook viewer (one of the most powerful\n>   features of the IPython documentation from a user group perspective) and\n>   examples (notebook gallery) (see IPython example)\n> \n> Yup, along with what those examples illustrate, how they play with the\n> rest of the docs, eliminating redundancy, etc.  That's where we've fallen\n> so badly behind.\n> \n> Plan\n> 1. ASAP Highest priority - Have at least one location where all\n>    documentation can be accessed easily. This will likely be interim in terms\n>    of design but important to have as a start toward integrating the docs that\n>    live in different repos yet the user may wish to access easily while\n>    setting up their environment and workflows.\n> 2. come up ASAP with a standard conf.py (sidebars, links) and index.rst\n>    (consistent table of contents structure for a project) templates for\n>    existing and new documentation on RTD (These two files are what I'm\n>    referring to as a standard Jupyter theme or more simply Jupyter doc\n>    standard.)\n> 3.

I'm sure along the way, you'll find lots of\ninconsistencies, circular links, dead-ends, etc.  But precisely having your\nlead on this problem will let us finally make progress on this mess, thanks\nso much :)\n\nf\n\n## \n\nFernando Perez (@fperez_org; http://fperez.org)\nfperez.net-at-gmail: mailing lists only (I ignore this when swamped!)\nfernando.perez-at-berkeley: contact me here for any direct mail\n",
