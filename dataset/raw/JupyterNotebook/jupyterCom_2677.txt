    "body": "cf the long discussion in ipython/ipython#4113.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this approach is that the numbering is reset with every render of a cell. If you have multiple cells with equations, then you wind up with redundant numbering. When every cell has a single equation, then each equation winds up with an equation number of 1 (not a very useful numbering).\r\n![eqnumber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5728311/28471365-c2a9f6ea-6df1-11e7-800b-f7c93771a7c8.png)\r\nThe conclusion reached in ipython/ipython#4113 was to decouple the two parts of this PR, and make equation numbering configurable (and probably off by default). Then you could make the equations have a global numbering. The downside of the global numbering (as you note), is if you try to retypeset an equation, it messes up the labeling and it won't render correctly at all. That is where the second part comes in: rather than try to clear the numbering before every typeset, just make it a user command accessible from the command palette. I probably agree with this approach.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "So, to be clear, this was explicitly _not_ enabling equation numbering. But rather it was eliminating the labels that were otherwise applied in a permanent form inside the notebook (meaning you couldn't render a cell with an equation with a label more than once without it breaking).\r\n\r\nSo because of that… it would be impossible to decouple this feature because it isn't about equation numbering.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that part of my journey to get to this point _did_ get equation numbering working… but I turned it off for this PR. This is more generally useful, and doesn't run into the rerendering $C(n,2)-1$ issue that we have to deal with when rendering cells initially with the appropriate Preprocess and Rerender calls. \r\n\r\nAlso, getting _numbering_ to work properly requires rerendering all mathjax and therefore markdown cells on every instance of cell movement (insertion, deletion, shifting, pasting) & every new render of a markdown cell. \r\n\r\nIf we were to do that, we'd have to add a rerender call to the deletion event. The other manipulation commands are taken care. \r\n\r\nThis has a double issue of our current way of handling mathjax having a 2 or 3 step rendering process which results in an unspleasant shifting in the page's vertical content as the different pieces of mathjax are renrendered multiple times. \r\n\r\nStill this can be merged without dealing with _any_ of those things.",

    "body": "> I'm not sure how traitlets get propagated up to the js side of things, but if someone can point me to a case where that is done, I'm happy to make a PR.\r\n\r\nIn ipywidgets, there is a [manager base class](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/base/src/manager-base.ts) that handles comm messages and a [widget base class](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/base/src/widget.ts#L538-L553) that uses the manager to provide a traitlets-like interface. [The widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/controls/src/widget_core.ts) subclass the widget base class and define a model and view (like in traitlets) and the view can access the model and render it. Here is an example: [HTMLMathModel](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/controls/src/widget_string.ts#L71-L79) and [HTMLMathView](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/controls/src/widget_string.ts#L81-L107)",
