    "body": "That's definitely not a dependency. What appears to have happened is that jupyter_declarativewidgets was installed at some point on your system, and was registered as a notebook server extension. Subsequently, you have set up an env without it, or otherwise uninstalled it, but it's still registered as an extension in config. What's failing is the loading of the extension (that's the `init_server_extensions` part). You can look for `jupyter_declarativewidgets` in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.{py,json}` and see where it is added to your configuration, and remove it there.\n",
