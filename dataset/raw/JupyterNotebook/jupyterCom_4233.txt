However, the BeakerX application files are not available to this python environment - so can't be imported.\r\n\r\nI would recommend either installing [BeakerX](http://beakerx.com/) into your current python environment, or locate your configuration file (or startup command) and remove the setting of `KernelSpecManager.kernel_spec_class`.  \r\n\r\nHere's the applicable excerpt from the `--help-all` output..\r\n```\r\n--KernelSpecManager.kernel_spec_class=<Type>\r\n    Default: 'jupyter_client.kernelspec.KernelSpec'\r\n    The kernel spec class.
