Can anybody enlighten me what else I need to do?\r\n\r\nMy python environment is:\r\n- windows 10\r\n- python 3.7.7\r\n- anaconda3 2020.2\r\n- conda 4.8.2\r\n- jupyter 1.0.0\r\n- ipython 7.13.0\r\n- ipykernel 5.1.4\r\n- tensorflow 2.1.0\r\n- ... (basically try to install latest versions)\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n1. recreate conda env + add nb_conda\r\n1. clean kernels in `kernelspec` & make sure python path point to the correct my virtual environment in `kernel.json`\r\n1. change `python` path in `kernel.json` as following:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n \"argv\": [\r\n  \"python\",\r\n  \"-m\",\r\n  \"ipykernel_launcher\",\r\n  \"-f\",\r\n  \"{connection_file}\"\r\n ],\r\n \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\r\n \"language\": \"python\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm still getting this:\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-3d3a52651c8b> in <module>\r\n----> 1 import tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\n~\\scoop\\apps\\anaconda3\\current\\envs\\kg37\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     99 \r\n    100 # We still need all the names that are toplevel on tensorflow_core\r\n--> 101 from tensorflow_core import *\r\n    102 \r\n    103 # These should not be visible in the main tf module.\r\n\r\n~\\scoop\\apps\\anaconda3\\current\\envs\\kg37\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow_core\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     38 import sys as _sys\r\n     39 \r\n---> 40 from tensorflow.python.tools import module_util as _module_util\r\n     41 \r\n     42 from . _api.v2 import audio\r\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.python.tools'; 'tensorflow.python' is not a package\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I try `import sys; sys.executable`, then I can `import tensorflow as tf`, but I have another error below:\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-2-fc4c73cf54bb> in <module>\r\n----> 1 import tensorflow.keras.layers\r\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.keras.layers'; 'tensorflow.keras' is not a package\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `import tensorflow` and `import tensorflow.keras.layers` work fine in terminal (in python as well as ipython), so I believe there is something wrong in jupyter environment, but I can't identify them.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help me this issue???\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI figured it out myself. I'm leaving the way how it got fixed, so someone might need to try this.\r\nI just moved the notebook what I'm trying to run *to the root path*. \r\nThe relative path of the notebook before was something like `samples/forcasting/covid-rnn.ipynb`, and as soon as I moved this to `./covid-rnn.ipynb`, the issue magically was gone.\r\nI know some of the issues that people had caused by file names like `csv.py`, which was the same name as python package.\r\nIn my case, when tensorflow try to import submodules, somehow my notebook's relative path mess with it. It still doesn't make sense for me that other packages work just fine except the ones with `tensorflow`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
