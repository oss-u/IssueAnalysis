That tab is because of the colon you are using for \"sess\" in the following line:\r\n`sess: sql.orm.Session = Session() <\\n>`\r\n\r\nIt is parsing that as a python identifier for indentation from the next line. That is not a problem of Jupyter notebook, maybe you have only one for sess, but if you have multiple lines you probably must use tabs for them. That's why the default indentation.",
