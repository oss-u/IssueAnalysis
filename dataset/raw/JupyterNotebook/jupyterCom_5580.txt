    "body": "This implies the code you're running within your R kernel is terminating the kernel process.  As a result, Notebook detects the process has stop which triggers its auto-restart logic. Since the termination was triggered via the cell's execution, I suspect the restart succeeds, but you are unable to execute this code, which triggers another restart when attempted.  I suggest two things:\r\n\r\n1. Try to ensure this code succeeds via another R-based mechanism (R-Studio perhaps?)\r\n2. Open an issue in the [IRkernel repository](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/issues) - assuming that's the flavor or R kernel you're using.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the issue since this Notebook server is working as designed.",
