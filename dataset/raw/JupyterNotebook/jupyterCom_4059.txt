I found that disabling the variableInspector (https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector) extension solved my problem.\r\n\r\nI was using JupyterLab v0.34.9 and variableInspector v0.1.0. In my case this appears to be related to https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector/issues/59",
