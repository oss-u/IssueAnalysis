Handwaving we would _like_ jupyterlab to be the default UI in a year or so, and progressively transition to the current notebook being an extension that we will slowly sunset.\n\nDepending on your timescale and your short/long term plans, you might want to also have a look at the current state of JupyterLab.

We are working together with @samarsultan team on addressing various RTL languages requirements. Can you please share which component is used as rich text editor in JupyterLab ? In JupyterNotebook CodeMirror editor (https://codemirror.net/) is used. My team is working on contribution of missing support for RTL languages to this editor. In case JupyterLab is going to be based on some other editor I would be very much interested to know which one. This way we can assess and contribute missing functionality into the right component. Many thanks for your help and guidance. \n",

    "body": "Hi @tomerm, \n\nCurrently most of JupyterLab is [based on CodeMirror](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/src/notebook/codemirror/cells/widget.ts), though there is nothing preventing multiple panel to use different editors. [The following issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/875) track the progress for making editor an abstract component and having the ability to replace CodeMirror if desired ([Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) for example, was mentioned). A lot of in person discussion have been done yesterday as most of the team is currently in San Luis Obispo for a bi-yearly meeting, so I would expect some update soon.\n\nDoes that help ?\n",

Future version of Jupyter (now called JupyterLab) was known for quite a while but there was  never clear understanding about time line (even on a very high level it was not clear if new product will be released one year from now or 5 years from now etc..). That is why efforts are currently invested in technology which is de-facto used by customers (Jupyter Notebook - CodeMirror). But we should always carefully review the roadmap and technological dependencies to make right choices down this path. \n",

    "body": "Thanks @tomerm, \n\nThe exact timeline is still hard to project for now, but we are starting to be able to give a rough timeline. \nNo promise yet, but it should something along:\n- if you are planning to deploy jupyterlab and have custom extensions or want to make relatively involved proposal in the design/api ; Nowish is the right time. \n- It is not ready for production and day-to-day use. If you want to you _can_, there is still some rough edges for a few workflow.\n- If you can use it a couple of hours each week to see progress and report back on what is annoying that would be great. (We ourself become blind to some usability as we might work too close to the code)\n- A beta / version 0.9 should be release late 2016, early 2017. \n- We want a stable 1.0 by mid 2017\n- Start to sunset the current notebook shortly after if the transition goes well. \n\nAll of the above schedule depends (among other things) about community involvement and time the can  be injected into jupyterlab.\n\n@ellisonbg and @jasongrout might have a more detail schedule or correct me. \n",
