That will at least confirm that the kernel process is responding to interrupt signals.  This is a finer-grained approach to restart since restart terminates the kernel process altogether.  Depending on the kernel, the output produced from the successfully processed interrupt may lend some hints as to where things _may be blocked_ within your training.\r\n\r\n- You could also try to locate the kernel process (assuming you have access to the Notebook server) and monitor its resource stats.  E.g., is memory or cpu time increasing despite no output appearing in the browser, etc.",

Smells like things are blocked on something and _that something_ isn't cooperating.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this will probably take a few more cycles so feel free to reach out to me via email and we can take this off-line.  We can update the issue later or others can chime in with their thoughts as well.\r\n\r\nJust a few more ideas...\r\n1. Is your training data the same as when this completed successfully?  If not, have you tried slicing the data into smaller chunks then build it back up?\r\n2. You're probably using some third-party software (e.g., spark, tensorflow, etc.), have you enabled debug tracing via those applications/libraries?\r\n3. Is the notebook log/output completely silent?  If you haven't already, I would start Notebook with `--log-level=DEBUG`.   ",
