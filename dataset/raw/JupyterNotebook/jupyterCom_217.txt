The new `notebook_list` object is then added to the `env` local to `ActionHandler` in `treeaction.js`, via a `.set_notebooklist` function I added to the `KeyboardManager` prototype.\n  Added new functions to the `NotebookList` prototype to handle keyboard events:\n`.get_selected_index`\n`.get_length_siblings`\n`.select_row`\n`.open`\n  Created  the actions file for instances of notebooklist, `tree/js/treeactions.js`, which is a copy of `notebook/js/actions.js`, but has different enters in the `_actions` object.\n  Created a set of default shortcuts for the file tree by adding `.get_default_tree_shortcuts` to the `KeyboardManager` prototype, which returns action names for 'enter', 'j', and 'k'.\n  Also, added a `view` variable to the `KeyboardManager` prototype in order to differentiate when to build shortcuts for the file tree or for a newly created notebook. This variable is updated in `KeyboardManager.prototype.bind_events`.\n",
