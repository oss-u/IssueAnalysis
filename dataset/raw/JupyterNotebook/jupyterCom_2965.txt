    "body": "A few comments on toolbars in general, based on work with the Bloomberg designers and Cooper's About Face.\r\n\r\n* Cooper claims that \"toolbars give experienced users fast access to frequently used functions\"\r\n* Both Cooper and the Bloomberg designers clarified that menus (main menus and context menus) tend to be the go to for new users who are learning a UI for the first time. In JupyterLab this is reflected by our mostly ignoring toolbar design right now and instead focusing on menus.\r\n* They also said that good menus should migrate users to keyboard shortcuts as quickly as possible (skipping toolbar usage entirely).\r\n* Bloomberg designers felt that having text along with icon buttons becomes important for actions that have pictures that are not as recognizable. However, Cooper says the most important thing for toolbar icons is that they are memorable, rather than recognizable. IOW, it matters less what the icon is, and more that a user can remember it. He also says that tooltips provide a nice compromise that let's a user discover the purpose of a button, without always showing text.\r\n* Well designed menus can also show icons that match those used on toolbar icon buttons.\r\n\r\nSome of these things are probably out of scope for the classic notebook (showing icons and keyboard shortcuts in menus, context menus, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn light of Cooper's I think the play, stop and restart buttons are memorable enough without text (they have tooltips). \r\n\r\nI agree that \"restart and run all\" is a good candidate for inclusion in the toolbar. We *should* be encouraging users to verify that notebooks run as they expect. In terms of its visual design, I think we are more likely to design a new custom icon that pick an existing one that has that meaning. I can have @hzarea work up some ideas.\r\n\r\nping @acrule who is thinking about ways encouraging users to write \"good\" notebooks from the HCI perspective. \r\n ",

It's a pain for _me_ to run!\r\n\r\nSo from this perspective,\r\n\r\nIf we are pitching notebooks as one solution to the reproducibility/repeatability problem, it needs to be easy to rerun from the start in a clean environment - single click toolbar, and/or keyboard shortcut with no confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf we are hoping to successfully onboard new users from less computationally expert backgrounds, there should be a simple canonical low-working-memory-overhead way to do it that is available on default installs.",

It would be great if the \"restart and run\" icon were logically a visual combination of \"restart\" and \"run\", even if we have to redesign \"restart\" and \"run\" to make that possible.\r\n\r\nOn a related point, I have started to create coding paradigms that allow me not to lose computationally expensive results, like @betatim was worried about:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif net.saved():\r\n    net.load()\r\n    net.plot_loss_acc()\r\nelse:\r\n    net.train(epochs=10000, accuracy=1.0, report_rate=50, \r\n              tolerance=0.4, batch_size=len(net.dataset.train_inputs), \r\n              plot=True, record=100)\r\n    net.save()\r\n```\r\nThat is, the first time through, it runs (trains a neural network, can take a long time) but subsequently it reloads the network. Output is the same either way. (Can also be accomplished with variables in previous cells). This kind of strategy can be part of recommendations for best-practices.",
