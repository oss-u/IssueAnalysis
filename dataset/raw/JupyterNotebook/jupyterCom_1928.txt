    "body": "tldr; sounds like you should be fine if you have lots of empty cells around, since this wouldn't affect most of those cells (none of them if multiple cells are at the end).\r\n\r\nI understand keeping empty cells around; but this actually wouldn't affect that in most cases. Any cells in the middle would be untouched. The solution I proposed was not removing anything if there were at least 2 cells at the end.\r\n\r\nI had originally proposed it be off by default, but now that I'm thinking about it, there's a good case for making it default. It actually wouldn't affect anyone who likes keeping lots of cells around at the end, and if it were default it would make more people's demo'd/example/screencast/expository/documentation notebooks nicer to look at.\r\n\r\nAnd, if the feature were on by default, the thought was it'd always be possible to just turn this off using a configuration option.\r\n\r\nBonus: it sounds like you could achieve both the upside at the same time as preserving your workflow. I.e., my guess is you wouldn't be bothered in practice because the auto-cleanup wouldn't affect any of your \"middle\" cells (preserving exploration) and it would only remove at most one at the end (and only if there was exactly one, that you hadn't been interacting with). That one cell being deleted would be as easy to recreate as it is to navigate to the cell; just one keystroke (assuming you're either using the keyboard shortcuts or autocreating cells by executing code with â†²).",
