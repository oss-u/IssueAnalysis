Please update your notebook and you should see it go to version 6.0.3.  The other components look good although I'm not that familiar with the jupyterlab versions to know about that.\r\n\r\nI also suggest getting in the habit of terminating the previously running notebook server prior to starting the next (assuming that's what is occupying the 5 ports).  This minimizes confusing results should you point your browser at one of the previous instances and wonder why things are still the way they are.  Been there, done that. :blush:",

However there are no anaconda packages inside like `jupyter notebook` or others, no `anaconda-navigator`...   \r\nAlso, for some reason (when I am **not in the environment**, just regular bash shell) `$PATH` is not set up to the `/bin` directory in anaconda, just to `/condabin`. I am not able to run nothing except `conda` command from shell after recommended installation.  \r\nCan you tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks once again.\r\n",

My understanding is that conda installs an initial _base_ environment that, if you don't create other envs, is used at all times.  When you created your snakes env, you instructed it to create it for python 3.6 but not anything else.  As such, I believe python will then use the base env as a fallback for package references not found in `snakes`, resulting in the kinds of confusion commonly experienced.\r\n\r\nIf you want jupyter in the snakes env, then you'd need something like `conda install jupyter -c conda-forge` from an activated snakes env.  This will then install the primary jupyter-relative packages and their dependencies.  You could also do this when creating the env with something like: `conda create --name snakes python=3.6 jupyter` (I'm pretty sure :smile:)\r\n\r\nRegarding the PATH relative to conda, I really don't know things well enough to begin to help - sorry.  However, Jupyter has a rich set of Python expertise and it would be great if someone could swing by and drop a note or some \"go to\" references that they find helpful - wink, wink.",

Also, good thing is that anaconda is not messing with system python, as newest python is being launched inside environment and proper`$PATH` is set up just inside environment. If only, for some reason, specific version of python is needed, then it makes sense; otherwise I would be just using default one. ",
