    "body": "I've narrowed it down a little further. Its the case where inner code within {curly brackets} contains a string, e.g. `print(f\"Dictionary Value: some_dict['some_key']\")`\r\n\r\nJupyter's text formatter seems to forget it was already inside a string (started by the first speech mark), starts a new one upon seeing the apostrophe, closes that with the second apostrophe as it should do, then opens a new one with the final speech mark. Thus it believes anything thereafter should be a string and it doesn't think the print function's bracket is closed. It then forgets all about it on the next line, besides automatically indenting due to the open bracket.",
