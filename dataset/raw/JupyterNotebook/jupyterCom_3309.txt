    "body": "Hi @takluyver , thanks for your reply. Including @mgeier as requested.\r\n\r\nYou are right, I was able to get rid of the 404 errors by just creating empty map files on the correct folders, and it didn't alter the behavior of the dashboard (still didn't work).\r\n\r\nI edited `notebook/static/edit/js/main.min.js`, changing the assignment from\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (inverse) {\r\n    [fg, bg] = [bg, fg];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (inverse) {\r\n    tmp = fg; fg = bg; bg = tmp;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich got the dashboard working. But I was getting the same error when trying to create or edit notebooks. The chrome console pointed me to `notebook/static/base/js/utils.js`, which I then edited in the same way as before (changing the assignment). Now everything is working as expected. My guess is that it might have something to do with Javascript version.\r\n\r\nMy Chrome version is 44.0.2403.125 m. Only extension installed is Docs version 0.0.0.6.\r\nI am running jupyter from a virtual environment, installation via pip. Please indicate whatever information might be useful, I'll be glad to provide it.",
