It should update the path for the notebook file in the frontend, and then do a regular save (i.e. a PUT request to the URL of the new file).\r\n\r\nThis is in line with how 'save as' works in most applications: it changes the file path you're working on, so if you open A and then 'save as' B, subsequent saves will write B until you use 'save as' again.\r\n\r\nSome applications have a separate 'save a copy' action, which lets you write file B but keep working on A.

Rename and move are the same operation in the REST API, and I thought we'd made the GUI so that rename could move it to a different folder, but I was wrong about that.\r\n\r\n>  I think it would be easier to decide what to do if we fix on how \"Save As\" should behave - save a new notebook in the current directory or anywhere relative to root_dir ?\r\n\r\nI think it should be able to save anywhere under the server root directory, but in terms of the UI, it should work relative to the directory the notebook is already in. So if I start the notebook server at `/home/takluyver` and open a notebook `/home/takluyver/foo/ThisNotebook.ipynb`, then 'Save as' should assume that I want to stay in the `foo` folder unless I tell it otherwise.",
