Looks like an issue of the default_url not being set to a) user provided default url or b) default /tree correctly when the app is initialized. Do we need to update the init function as well https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/notebookapp.py#L849 ?\n",

I found it a bit counterintuitive to set default_url since it's relative to where the notebook is launched on the file system. Has anyone requested setting to a specific directory (using a complete path) so that the default directory pops up from anywhere the notebook is launched on the system? Or is this already in the configuration settings?\n",
