    "body": "> Is there something else, that could be the cause of this?\r\n\r\nI don't believe so. If you have jupyterhub 0.7.0 or greater, the `jupyterhub-singleuser` script is only a few lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/prefix/bin/python\r\n\r\nfrom jupyterhub.singleuser import main\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo a traceback in that file means you have `jupyterhub-singleuser` from pre-0.7. It's possible that you have installed the current jupyterhub, but the old `jupyterhub-singleuser` script is still present and still being launched. You might try searching for it in your container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfind / -name jupyterhub-singleuser\r\n# or\r\nwhich -a jupyterhub-singleuser\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Can you share the rest of your Dockerfile? What's your base image (`FROM ...`)? If you are installing jupyterhub from 0.7, then the file with these contents won't be created, so it is presumably leftover from a previous installation. Since I see from your traceback that you are using conda in `/opt/conda` and single-user is installed at `/usr/local/bin/`, installing jupyterhub won't go in `/usr/local`, it will go somewhere like `/opt/conda/bin/jupyterhub-singleuser`. The commands I pasted above:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfind / -name jupyterhub-singleuser\r\n# or\r\nwhich -a jupyterhub-singleuser\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould point to the possibility of more than one install. You can also try removing `/usr/local/bin/jupyterhub-singleuser` prior to installing JupyterHub, to make sure this file isn't present.",
