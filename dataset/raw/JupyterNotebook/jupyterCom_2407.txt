    "body": "@takluyver I'd rather not share it yet. It will be shared later for free and everyone (once it is working and deployed on a server and so on), who wants to test it and I'll need test users, but that is later and it is still in the development late phase. It will be used to get some test results for a master thesis, and I am not so sure about testing principles and how sharing early could affect testing results or the number of test users I will find.\r\n\r\nI now put into my `jupyter_notebook_config.py` the following additional lines:\r\n\r\n    c.NotebookNotary.data_dir = \"/home/\" + os.getenv('NB_USER') + \"/.local/share/jupyter/\"\r\n    c.NotebookNotary.db_file = \"/home/\" + os.getenv('NB_USER') + \"/.local/share/jupyter/nbsignatures.db\"\r\n    c.NotebookNotary.secret_file = \"/home/\" + os.getenv('NB_USER') + \"/.local/share/jupyter/notebook_secret\"\r\n\r\nAnd copied my files into the container instead of running the `jupyter trust` command. So far it did not work, but it might be I copied not up to date files in. In the process I destroyed my Anaconda env somehow, so I'll have to recreate it and then see where it creates these signature and secret files, in order to test again if I can go that route. However, the trust command would be better, since it involves no manual steps in the process, except once writing it into the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can manually install `nbformat 4.3`? I might try it once I get my env up again, thanks for mentioning, that there is a newer version, maybe that will be the key later.",
