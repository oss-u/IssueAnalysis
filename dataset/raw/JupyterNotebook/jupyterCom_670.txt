Click the **New** button (upper-right) and from the drop-down choose \"Python 2\" or \"Python 3\" from the **Notebooks** section\n2. (The notebook should open in a new tab) In the first cell, do some Python, maybe like `print(\"Hello, world!\")`\n3. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to run the cell\n4. Observe the output\n5. Return to the original tab (leave the notebook running in the other tab)\n6. Click on **Running** again to see if there are any running notebooks (may have to refresh with `F5` key in your browser)\n7. Return to the active tab with the notebook running in it\n8. From the **File** menu, choose **Close and Halt**\n9. Re-visit the **Running** section of the original tab and see if there are any notebooks still running (again, you may have to refresh in your browser by using the `F5` key\n\nPlease give that a try and report back your status.\n",

    "body": "@metatl I am not personally familiar with iTorch, but it looks like it works generally like the Jupyter notebook in that it provides you with a notebook interface where you can write code and see the results in real-time, maintaining a living document of what you're doing as you interact with it. Though, the libraries it bundles are specific to Torch, which appears to be a machine learning framework. Sounds like cool stuff.\n\nA great place to start is to get to know how the Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebook works, by viewing some tutorial videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJx8WOUx5Xd3_dgw5xRmABUd8MWdsA_C\n\nIf you're already familiar with the Python language enough to play around, those should get you up and running until you can start to familiarize yourself with Torch and iTorch. Most likely you'll need to look to the iTorch documentation (and/or developers) for assistance with the Torch/iTorch libraries and how to use them. They have a few examples on their GitHub main page and also they link to a sample notebook which has some examples of things you can do. I hope that helps.\n",
