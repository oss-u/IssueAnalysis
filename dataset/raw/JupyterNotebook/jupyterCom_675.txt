What about this:\n- Define separate command for unmark all cells and close pager.\n- Have both of the actual logic for those commands do the same thing (see if pager is open, etc.).\n\nThat way, we won't have to change any command names once we get the scoped selectors.\n\nBut I am +1 on the behavior of this PR otherwise.\n",
