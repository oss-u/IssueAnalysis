    "body": "This sounds like your version of `pip` doesn't support the `python_requires` statement which `pyzmq` (21+) sets to `3.6`.  I would suggest you update `pip` or pin `pyzmq<21.0`, but there really isn't anything we should do from a notebook perspective.  When I use an updated `pip`, installation of `pyzmq` pulls in 20.x in python 3.5.\r\n\r\nOn the 3.5 support front, we discussed this today in the maintainer's meeting and decided that [dropping 3.5](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/5962) would be best.  As a result, you may need to look into pinning `notebook<6.3` as well.",
