    "body": "Adding to my comments above:\r\nStruggling away with pytorch 0.2.0. I am trying to run a Udemy deeplearning project on ubuntu 16.04 x64. Surprisingly enough the same project runs well on a Windows 10 laptop with an earlier version of pytorch on a conda python 3.5 env. So I created a conda python 3.5 env on ubuntu laptop to run things like tensorflow, pytorch, etc. \r\nMy problem is that after loading torch (import torch) at the top of my Python script, as soon as the script reaches the part where torch is enabled (torch.nn in this case) the script crashes, killing the kernel. I discovered that in a python window, i could \"import torch\" but when I do a torch.rand(4) as an example, i get an \"illegal instruction, core dumped\" so this is what is killing my script. I have a screenshot of this which I am attaching to this post. I hope this makes sense to any of the developers who are involved in the pytorch 0.2.0 project.\r\n\r\n![torch nn crashing 2017-09-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11564015/30295301-1c5929d2-970e-11e7-9c36-44ce564578b0.png)\r\n",
