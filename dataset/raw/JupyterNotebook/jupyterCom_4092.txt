    "body": "Hello,\r\nI also have this same problems that I'm not able to save and checkpoint the notebook (problems the same as described in the first post of #1882). The notebook is not trusted anymore and doesn't allow clicking to trust it. However, I don't have the TOC extenstion nor Ghostery so I'm not sure what's causing this problem.\r\n\r\nThere are no messages on the terminal when I try to save the notebook. \r\nThe previous messages mention 'starting buffering for [kernel id] ' and 'Adapting to protocol v5.1 for kernel'\r\nThese are the messages on the console preceding the problem:\r\n- Starting buffering for 9ab5bd0b...\r\n- Kernel restarted: 9ab5bd0b...\r\n- Adapting to protocol v5.1 for kernel 9ab5bd0b...\r\n- Restoring connection for 9ab5bd0b...\r\n- Replaying 3 buffered messages\r\n\r\nI reinstalled Anaconda (to defaults of 5.3.0 with py3.7) which made no difference. This problem occurs in both the notebook and jupyter lab.\r\n\r\nWorking on MacOS 10.12.6, Firefox 62.0.3.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
