    "body": "Hi @ZxMYS - I'm not up on the complete history of the contents service, but I suspect you're just running into outdated behaviors that should probably be updated.   I'm also not sure what kinds of ramifications this would have on existing ContentsManager implementations - which is a primary concern.  I know you're focused on the checkpoint calls to the CM, but conversion to async can be like tugging on a loose thread, and the next thing you know the whole thing requires changes.  That said, I believe content services is in need of such an update.\r\n\r\nSince [Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server) is considered the next-gen server, there might be more leeway to make this kind of change there, although, again, we'd need to understand what it means for existing implementations and what the cost might be to continue using their CM.  (Hmm, they'll need to update their imports to the base classes anyway - so we might have more room here.)\r\n\r\nWe introduced a parallel hierarchy to make KernelManger asynchronous and allow the user to opt-in for async.  I suspect a similar approach might be necessary for this if done in notebook.   That was painful, although primarily due to there being multiple repositories involved (notebook and jupyter_client) - which isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nSorry for the ramble and indirect comments.",
