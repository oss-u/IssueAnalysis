    "body": "I don't understand the motovation for this PR. Master currently has a very clean set of abstractions that encode the idea of a cursor or active cell (selected) and a set of cells that are the target of an action (marked). These two abstractions are needed because of how selected is inextricably tied to the browsers notion of focus. The only issue we have right now in master is the awkward functioning of the shift-j/k keyboard shortcuts and the `extend_marked` method those use. Let's just fix that.\n\nThis PR introduces a third abstraction (soft selected) that conflates and confuses all of this in a really awkward way. And the changes are not just implementation details that fix the shift-j/k shortcuts. It mixes it with new concepts and interactions in the UI that are overly complex.\n\nFrom the beginning of when @jdfreder and I started to talk about the marked cell concept, I was aware we would have to think carefully about how shift-j/k work. My design of the marked cells included background threads thinking about it.\n\nI see two ways of fixing it:\n- Remove the shift-j/k shortcuts and just support a Gmail style multiple style multiple selection. It is dead simple, conceptually clear and trivial to implement. It is also efficient if we pick a good shortcut for toggling marked.\n- Keep shift-j/k but add a simple state machine to the `extend_marked` methods that gives the canonical behavior. I think we could get most of the way there by simply looking at the marked state of the current cell before extending and using that information. We may need a notion of an anchor that these methods manage, but I am not at all convinced of that. But even if we do that should be an internal detail of these methods that doesn't propagate to the rest of the API or the user.\n",

    "body": "I honestly do not know how to do shift-J/K with a state machine correctly.\n\nAnd again, if it's a state machine I do not know how we will describe to user how it works. \n\nAnd personally I see a leakage of abstraction between marked state and selected state. Which is better now that the selected cell is implicitly marked. \n\nThis is my attempt at fixing it. In all normal user UI, not only would Shift-J/K/Up/down work with anchor/cursor, but once you have a selection moving the cursor deselect all. Which is not what the notebook does. Which we try to work around with indicators of the number of marked cell. \n\nFor me the marked marked state is useful but **is** the complicated part of the API. It **is** the state-full part that need the user to keep in it's mind. \n\nIn my opinion, there are many more user **just** need contiguous select than user that need marked cells. \n\nAnyway, this is a PR to see what can be done, I'm ok for it to not be merged, \nbut after playing with it for a day, I like it much more that the current branch than master. I even doubt of the usefulness of non-contiguous selection. \n",

It is also efficient if we pick a good shortcut for toggling marked.\n\nThis is probably the best idea for now, since it seems there is a general disagreement on the behavior and falling back to providing neither is simple.\n\nAlthough @Carreau I still like the arrows and the left/right kb shortcuts instead of toggle.  Also, implementation details aside, the head/anchor notion of selection is definitely the most intuitive for the unexpecting user.\n",

Like in Gmail you cannot merge mails. \nAnd each thread is roughly unrelated to each other :non-contiguous selection make sens. The probability you select thread N+1 is uncorrelated to Thread N. It is not the case in the notebook. \n\nj/x sequences to select N cells is twice the number of keystrokes that you need if using Shift-J, so I believe multiple selection is more useful that non-contiguous marking. \n\nI do understand the need of discontinuous marking, and I do not dismiss it's utility. \nI completely agree that we need an API for that. What I disagree with is the semantics on how it's applied. and I believe that the way it's implemented right now is incompatible with a non confusing UI/keyborad shortcut. \n\nI think that one of the possible solution is to have multiple selection. \n\n> I agree that some actions should not work on discontiguous selections -\n> that is why we have methods on the Notebook class for querying if a set of\n> cells is contiguous or not. Actions that should only apply to contiguous\n> selections should use these methods to test the current selection.\n\nI'm worried of the complexity involved here, and I would like to to reach 90% of users with 10% of the efforts. One of the reason I liked to videochat with you is to clarify the meaning of words selection/marking/soft_selection and so on and so forth, as most of the discussion are impaired by us using different term for same things, and same terms for different things.\n\nSo let's try to clarify what action we want the user to be able to do, scenario that we think should not happend/are confusing (regardless of implementation) and look at various possible implementation. I'll open a google docs for that. \n",

Same in file managers.\n\nIn general, selections are marking parts of your workspace for \"drastic action\", so they are meant to be ugly, bright, impossible to miss.  I find these side marks way, way too small, and against every convention in UX of this kind in computing.\n",
