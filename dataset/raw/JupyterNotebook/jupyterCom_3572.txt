    "body": "Ah, I think I know why that can cause a problem. I guess the list is being displayed with a `display_data` or `execute_result` message, rather than being sent through a stream by print() or similar.\r\n\r\nWe consider two things for the rate limiting: the number of messages sent in a time window, and the number of bytes of stream data sent in a time window. It's easy for the first one to fail if one message contains a very large amount of data, and if it's not a stream message, it dodges the second check completely.\r\n\r\nI guess the fix is to consider display_data and execute_result messages for the byte-rate limit if the data would be displayed as plain text. The drawback is that that requires the server to duplicate some understanding of the frontend's display preference order, but it's probably sufficient to just check if `text/plain` is the only data format in the message.",
