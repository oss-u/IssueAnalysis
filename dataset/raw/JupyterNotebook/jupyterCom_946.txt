    "body": "Has it been considered if Jupyter kernels could provide code formatting? I got a feature request to integrate rustfmt into the evcxr (Rust) Jupyter kernel. If it were just a matter of implementing an API in the kernel that accepted a string and returned that string auto-formatted, it'd be pretty easy. But I'm not sure I want to write custom client-side code to call the auto-formatter in the kernel. For starters, if every kernel did that, then there'd be many different and inconsistent UIs for how to trigger auto-formatting.",
