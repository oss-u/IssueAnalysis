    "body": "I wanted to be able to recognize a running Jupyter Notebook or Lab at a glance.\r\nSince I run Jupyter from a Conda shell, by default Notebooks or Lab sessions always present the same icon.\r\nSo, I decided to create two series of icon sets, one for Jupyter Notebook and the other for Jupyter Lab, starting from the published resources in the GitHub repository jupyter/notebook/docs/resources/.\r\n\r\nThe two series of icons are in both IOS (with the extension ‘.icns’) and Windows (with the extension ‘.ico’) format.\r\n\r\nThe zip file is organized as follows:\r\n1.\tRoot Dir: ‘Jupyter Icons Tastes’\r\n\r\n    1.1.   Subdir: ‘Orange Bkg’\r\n            Orange background icons.\r\n            They are the ones that perform best in my opinion\r\n\r\n    1.2.   Subdir ‘White Bkg’\r\n            White background icons.\r\n            They are harder to distinguish than the orange background ones, especially in small formats.\r\n\r\n    1.3.   Subdir: ‘Standard’\r\n            The same, identical, icon sets of the ‘Orange Bkg’ dir, but with simplified names:\r\n                Jupyter Lab.icns\r\n                Jupyter Notebook.icns\r\n                Jupyter Lab.ico\r\n                Jupyter Notebook.ico\r\n\r\n[Jupyter Icons Tastes.zip](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/files/4673367/Jupyter.Icons.Tastes.zip)\r\n",
