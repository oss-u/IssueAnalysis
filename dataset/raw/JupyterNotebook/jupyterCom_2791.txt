    "body": "The problem I have with jupyter notebooks in general is that it starts out pretty neat; you write an experiment or report and then as the notebook grows, the notebook becomes messy. A double column mode would aid in creating a nice oversight of where what code runs. Alternative would be to hide the code blocks as that takes a lot of space. My main workflow involves plotting in jupyter and for complex scientific figures this often takes \"a lot\" of code. ",
