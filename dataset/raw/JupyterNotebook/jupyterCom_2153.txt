You can define many type of shorctuts and sequences of keys.\r\nUse dashes - to represent keys that should be pressed with modifiers, for example Shift-a, or Ctrl-;.\r\nSeparate by commas if the keys need to be pressed in sequence: h,a,l,t.\r\nYou can combine the two: Ctrl-x,Meta-c,Meta-b,u,t,t,e,r,f,l,y. Casing will have no effects: (e.g:  ; and : are the same on english keyboards). You need to explicitelty write the Shift modifier. Valid modifiers are Cmd, Ctrl, Alt ,Meta, Cmdtrl. Refer to developer docs for the corresponding keys depending on the platform.You can hover on the name/description of a command to see its exact internal name and differentiate from actions defined in various plugins. Changing the keybindings of edit mode is not yet possible.\r\n```\r\n\r\nthings that need to be added: Modifier are (IIRC) case sensitive. Cmdtrl is Command on mac, ctrl on windows/linux. Meta is Alt/Option (IIRC). space comma dash/minus need to be explicitly spelled out. ",

It means that just pressing Shift will do nothing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Is there a reason it's - rather than + to delimit combinations?\r\n\r\nCause that's standard (Vim, Atom, Emacs) along with no delimiter. \r\nThe difference is tha instead of comma atom use space. There are some slight variation though. \r\n\r\nEsc is hardcoded (and have to be hardcoded) in many places. because it has other side effects on many browsers. ",
