    "body": "Let me start out by saying that I don't have any experience using AMD and RequireJS and I have a lot of experience using CommonJS and Webpack. Webpack is great because it allows you to use a lot of the good things about Node.js (CommonJS, npm) within the browser by bundling all of your modules into a file that can be used within a `<script>` tag. With Webpack, it's easy to use external modules (such as browser libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap) from within the bundle without actually bundling them using the `externals` config. This would allow the core notebook (bundled by Webpack) to access extensions (not bundled). However, I don't know of any good/safe way to allow extensions to access the notebook core, but like @blink1073 mentioned, there are a couple Webpack plugins that would enable this:\n- [DllPlugin and DllReferencePlugin](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/list-of-plugins#dllplugin): Webpack plugin that allows one bundle to provide modules (e.g. vendor bundle) to another consumer bundle (e.g. app bundle). I couldn't find an example of consuming a DLL bundle outside of Webpack (only examples of a provider bundle using the DllPlugin and a consumer using the DllReferencePlugin).\n- [script-loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/shimming-modules.html#exposing): Webpack loader that will evaluate a module in the global context (like a `<script>` tag).\n- [expose-loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/shimming-modules.html#exposing): Webpack loader that will export a module to the global context.\n\nIt appears that all of these options would enable extensions to access the notebook core by exposing the notebook core to the global context, which is not a good solution.\n\n> I expect that we should be able to deal with this in JupyterLab by making the extension points more clearly defined exported functions / events / observables / etc., Rather than allowing full access to everything in extensions. If we do that, extensions shouldn't need to be able to extend prototypes on Cell, etc. which is the source of the problems we have in the notebook right now (and then the fact that they cannot extend these prototypes becomes a good thing).\n\nI have experience developing Atom packages and if you look at Atom's API, it also exposes an [`atom` global](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.9.8/AtomEnvironment#instance-confirm) that allows packages to subscribe to events, get state, and safely set state. Instead of \"extending the prototype of a [TextEditor],\" a package can render custom UI within a TextEditor by [calling a method](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/blob/ac31c110903ae2d6009624441521116dbb840aac/lib/main.coffee#L243) on that editor. \n\nI'm not familiar with the current notebook- or jupyterlab-extension API, so I would need to see some docs/examples to offer any suggestions regarding _to Webpack or not to Webpack_.\n\n@rgbkrk I know that nteract is using Electron (the same native shell that Atom uses) and therefore doesn't require Webpack, but do you have any insights nonetheless?\n",
