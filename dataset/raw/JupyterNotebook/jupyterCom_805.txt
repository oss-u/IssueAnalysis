We can discuss that later on, and we already discussed that (with Jon and Fernando) during 4.1 meeting last Tuesday. \n\nSorry if it wasn't clear in above message I updated to reflect the status. \n\nWhile the solution you propose is close to what might be an ideal solution,\nthe complexity and edge cases in implementing it now, in comparison to the\nrare cases where this inconsistency shows up made us lean toward documenting that this is a known defect instead of hastily fixing it the wrong way. \n",
