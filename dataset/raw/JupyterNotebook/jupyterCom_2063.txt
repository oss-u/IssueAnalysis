    "body": "This appears to be due to a condition in traitlets [Config.merge](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/blob/master/traitlets/config/loader.py#L197) method. Config keys are only merged (as opposed to clobbered) if comparing two Config objects.  In the case of server extension configurations the ```nbserver_extensions``` key is not converted to a Config object during ```Config.__init__()```.  This means when nbserver_extensions sub-keys are compared recursively from different jupyter_notebook_config.json files (e.g. from separate ```--sys-prefix``` and ```--user``` installs) they are being compared as  ```dict``` rather than ```<class 'traitlets.config.loader.Config'>```. Because of this the outer scope (e.g. ```~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json``` ) clobbers the system-prefix scope (e.g. ```/path/to/virtual_environment/etc/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json```).\r\n\r\nTo illustrate:\r\n\r\n__jupyter_notebook_config.json installed with ```--sys-prefix```__\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n(jupyter_2063) kotfic@minastirith:~/tmp/jupyter_2063 ⇒ \\\r\ncat ~/.venvs/jupyter_2063/etc/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json\r\n{\r\n  \"NotebookApp\": {\r\n    \"nbserver_extensions\": {\r\n      \"geonotebook\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n__jupyter_notebook_config.json installed with ```--user```__\r\n```sh\r\n(jupyter_2063) kotfic@minastirith:~/tmp/jupyter_2063 ⇒ \\ \r\ncat ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json \r\n{\r\n  \"NotebookApp\": {\r\n    \"nbserver_extensions\": {\r\n      \"jupyter_nbextensions_configurator\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the time we complete [load_config_file](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/blob/master/traitlets/config/application.py#L658) nbserver_extensions will only contain ```{ \"jupyter_nbextensions_configurator\": True }```. Because displaying enabled/disabled plugins looks at each path individually (without merging) each plugin appears to be enabled.  But when the config is actually built the ```--sys-prefix``` installed configs will not be available.\r\n\r\n```nbserver_extensions``` is not converted to a Config object by [self._ensure_subconfig()](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/blob/master/traitlets/config/loader.py#L171) because ```_ensure_subconfig``` only converts items that pass the predicate function [_is_section_key](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/blob/master/traitlets/config/loader.py#L158-L163). ```nbserver_extensions``` does not pass this predicate because it is not **capitalized**.  \r\n\r\nI have verified that the merge of ```--user``` and ```--sys-prefix``` nbserver_extension elements works as expected if ```nbserver_extensions``` is converted to ```Nbserver_extensions``` and a [patch](https://gist.github.com/kotfic/8fc7221089a70640d726771e6652b397) is applied to change the trait in the notebook code. This is an unsatisfying but low impact fix.  Fully fixing the issue would require refactoring traitlet's Config object which would obviously have much wider impact. \r\n\r\nI am happy to put together a PR but I need a little guidance on how to proceed. Thanks!\r\n\r\n",

The frontend-specific `nbconfig` setup does, however, which makes more sense for what we are doing with extensions. I think we probably should have used the same extension system for both sides, rather than traitlets for one and a new setup for the other. This is part of what @SylvainCorlay is proposing in https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/21.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of a decent way to fix this beyond moving the nbserver_extensions off of traitlets to the nbconfig loader, and I'm not sure we want to change how we do this *yet again* for 5.0. Conceivably, we could use that loader on the regular config files, but that seems like asking for trouble. I can sketch it out, if we think it's worth investigating, though.",
