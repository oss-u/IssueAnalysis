    "body": "When I run python on serverA, the python executable in the NFS Mount serverB:/pathB/condaB/bin loads into the memory on serverA and runs there. If I type \"which python\" on serverA, it shows me /pathB/condaB/bin/python. If I run python on serverA and look at top, I see the process running on serverA. However, the binary executable is from serverB.\r\n\r\nFor stability, we need to run jupyter from serverA:/pathA/condaA/bin to be accessible from https://serverB/jupyter. However, if I open a notebook and type \"!which python\", I need to see \"/pathB/condaB/bin/python\", not \"/pathA/condaA/bin/python.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that serverB:/pathB/condaB/ is on the drive attached to our cluster. This is where we keep all of our software packages. serverA is a machine for development and interactive processing for jobs that may later be run on the cluster. So, they need to be developed with the exact same binaries as we would run on the cluster.\r\n\r\nAlso, ports 80 and 443 are closed on the cluster. However those ports are open on serverA in order to run jupyter and other apps.\r\n\r\nWe could have a process to regularly match up condaA with condaB. But it would be much simpler to have jupyter simply call the binary in /pathB/condaB/.\r\n\r\nSorry for the lengthy explanation. I just want to make sure I'm explaining the situation well enough.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\nAlso, the right-to-left arrow above \"NFS Mount\" is to indicate the binary on serverB is being loaded into serverA.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2**\r\nWhen I first wrote this, I completely switched A and B. I think it is correct now.",
