It would be nice to have a new tab in the dashboard (in addition to Files, Running and Cluster) that lists X number of recently opened notebooks. It would be nice to see when notebooks were last opened as well.\n\nThanks ! We'll consider it. It should be possible with an extension !\n\n> Keep up the great work!\n\nTHanks for using Jupyter and reporting feature requests !\n",
