That's exactly what I *do not* want. If I try to do `jupyter console --existing my_kernel.json`, then it would fail because none of the backend ZMQ processes have been organized with connection information embedded in the `my_kernel.json` file. What I *do* want is for my next session of `jupyter console` to use the port and ZMQ connection info saved in my `my_kernel.json` file. Thus, the new session would somehow have to start up ZMQ infrastructure according to the contents of the `my_kernel.json` file.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience with this question.",
