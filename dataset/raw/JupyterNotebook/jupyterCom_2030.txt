Fernando and I have talked extensively about the fact that the way Mathematica handles grouping through nesting is quite annoying if you use it for anything non-trivial.  Our idea is to implement grouping, but not nesting.  How would this work?\n\nWe would keep the notebook as a linear sequence of cells.  We would introduce different levels of heading cells, but these would be flat/inline (like latex section/subsection/subsubsection) rather than nested like the Mathematica notebook.  We feel this style of document will be easier to import/export to different formats and is much simpler for users to manage and for us to develop a UI for.  To introduce grouping like functionality, we thought about using the locations of different heading levels to identify logical groups that could be collapsed, moved and treated as a unit.  We feel this would give the desired benefits of grouping without the complexity of nesting.  The first step along with path is to create the heading cells, them we can start to think about a UI for using them as logical groups.\n",

But there are important reasons why this is not the right\r\nmodel for the notebook.\r\n- When it comes to authoring documents of almost any kind (pen/paper,\r\n  Word, Google Docs, Latex) the model that users are used to is a linear\r\n  sequence of text and headings with any hierarchy being only implicitly\r\n  defined by how heading levels are used.  Presenting an actual\r\n  hierarchy to users requires them to track that information in their\r\n  head increasing the cognitive load.  They have to translate thoughts\r\n  like \"I want to move section 1.B after section 1.C and rename it\r\n  section 2\" to their nested equivalent.\r\n- When I compare my experience in authoring documents in Mathematica\r\n  (explicit nesting) with LyX (flat, implicit nesting) there is a huge\r\n  difference.  In LyX, I just set the heading level of a section and\r\n  move on.  Once those headings are set, I can just type content without\r\n  any thought as to what level of nesting it appears at. With\r\n  Mathematica, representing sections using explicit nesting is horribly\r\n  painful - so much so that I avoid using it if at all possible.  When\r\n  you edit nested documents there are some operations (insertion/paste\r\n  is the worst, but also with indent/dedent) that are ambiguous.\r\n  Mathematica tries to guess how you want to handle these operations,\r\n  but inevitably, you end up fighting with it.  This is not a problem\r\n  with Mathematica per-se, but with the underlying model which itself\r\n  has these ambiguities.\r\n- UI complexity.  If you have a deeply nested, real hierarchy, you\r\n  have to reflect that in the UI.  Mathematica uses a sequence of\r\n  vertical lines on the R side of the document that span the\r\n  section/cells they group together.  For one level of nesting this\r\n  isn't bad.  But for multiple levels of nesting, you end up with a rats\r\n  nest of vertical lines and it become extremely difficult to figure out\r\n  which one you want to click to manage things.\r\n- Implementation complexity.  The linear sequence of cells is simple\r\n  to implement in both the notebook format and the UI.  I am\r\n  particularly concerned about the UI becoming too complex that we can't\r\n  implement it in a clean robust manner in a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\n> I also think performing actions on a group is more straightforward with nested structures (e.g. increase/decrease level, relocation, collapse/expand) because you invariably have the whole group as a single element in the structure, no matter what level.  When the list is flat, you have to reconstruct the group every time you perform group actions.\r\n\r\nWhile agree at the theoretical level, I have never found this to be\r\nthe case in authoring documents.\r\n",

I just have a couple of thoughts to add to this discussion:\n1. My original request was not directed exactly towards collapse/expand but more broadly to cell grouping. Collapse/expand is one of the things you can do with grouping and it's very important. I think it's more or less the equivalent of the \"include document\" functionality in Lyx: it lets you hide some parts of the document to focus your attention on others.\n2. However, there are two more things you can do with grouping (as far as I can tell):\n   - Delete/move a group. In Mathematica this is as easy as: select the group bracket (the blue vertical line, I mean), hit _Ctrl+X_ and then _Ctrl+V_ in another part of the notebook. I read in the last @fperez blog post that you plan to introduce an outline explorer similar to the Lyx one. Since this one also has the ability to move sections, I hope you could reproduce this functionality in IPython (although that seems a bit hard to do).\n   - Evaluate a particular group. Perhaps this is not well known but, again in Mathematica, if you select a group bracket and hit Shift+Enter, you can evaluate just that group. I find this quite neat and useful but I don't know if you could implement it with current flat model.\n\nAs a side note: @ellisonbg, I haven't experienced in Mathematica the indent/dedent problem you described: to indent you just have to introduce a new heading level with a lower precedence from the previous one and Mathematica will create the group automatically until the next higher heading it finds. To dedent you change the type of your group heading to a higher precedence one.\n\nTo conclude: I'm not saying that Mathematica's way of doing things is the only possible one but that IMHO the cases I described are worth considering when you're taking the next design decisions about grouping.\n\nJust my two cents,\nCarlos\n",

You are right that Mathematica allows other types of cell grouping, but we feel that this more constrained model is cleaner.\n\nThere is no reason at all why we can't add other group level actions such as move, delete, evaluate, etc.  We have to develop the UI for this, but I think the it is clear at the conceptual level.  The core underlying logic we will need is the following:  Given a Heading cell, we need to be able to walk the following cell and figure out which of them are \"under\" that heading.  I think the basic logic is that you keep going until you encounter another heading that has the same level or less as the starting one.  Once you have the list of contained cells, you can start to apply actions to the group of them.  The challenging part will be designing a clean and functional UI for all of this.\n",

The reason is a limitation imposed by Python itself: Python does not allow you to declare a class in multiple execution chunks (well, you can, but only using dynamic hacks that aren't very readable and which I will henceforth ignore).\n\nThis means that if we start using the notebook for declaring more complex classes, right now they have to live in a single, long cell.  This prevents you for example from inserting a text paragraph with a mathematical explanation before continuing with the next method.\n\nIt occurred to me that if we had a concept of a 'cell group' where all the cells in the group would be _unconditionally_ executed _always together, all of them_, then we'd solve this problem.  Consider creating a cell group as stated above, then when you hit Shift-Enter from any cell in the group, we actually send for execution the union of all the code cells in the group ignoring non-code ones.  Then, Python would always see them as a single cell, while the human could break up the visual layout between code and text as best fit the problem.\n\nThere are some UI challenges in how to best do this, but the more I think about it the more I like this idea.  It would make the notebook a very nice environment for literate programming in a way that no existing python tool allows.  Thoughts?\n",

Another phrasing of the same thing is essentially to have rich text comments without having to split a code block into separate executions.\n\nWith the implicit cell groups given by headings, we can actually make this work quite easily with optional behavior in 'run group', where it is _not_ run as separate completely independent executions, but concatenated prior to execution.  This is not difficult, but would lack the enforcement of a special notion of multi-textarea cell, and running the cells individually would be permitted, if not necessarily valid.\n",

Kudos to the ipython-contrib guys!\n\nThings I believe would remain to do:\n- Advertise hierarchical_collapse.js in the ipython-contrib wiki\n- Activate this by default in IPython (extensions are great for power users, but folding is a nice basic feature for newcomers, and at this point installing an extension is not a \"one-click\" thing)\n- Add keybord shortcuts (Alt-F as in the codefolding extension?)\n- Use some standard visual scheme (e.g. a little button at the left of the section header, as in the codefolding extension). A button in the title bar is not so practical as it requires moving a lot the pointer back and forth.\n- A cycle through mechanism? (show subsection titles, show all the section, collapose all the section)\n\nThanks!\n",
