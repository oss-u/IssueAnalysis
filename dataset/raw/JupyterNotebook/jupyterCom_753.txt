    "body": "That is the most official way we have right now. But in general, we would\nlike to move away from this. You can end up creating a mess with circular\nrefs between the DOM and JS objects this way and we would love to avoid it.\nAs we build the phosphor stuff, we are trying to figure out the\nabstractions that can replace this API though.\n\nOn Tue, Nov 24, 2015 at 2:08 PM, Gino Bustelo notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> For jupyter-incubator/declarativewidgets#125\n> https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/declarativewidgets/issues/125 we\n> needed a way to get a hold of the enclosing cell of one of our elements to\n> then have the correct callbacks to handle messages like display_data.\n> \n> We looked around and could not find a better way than to do\n> $(this).parents(\".cell\").data().cell (obviously with the right checks).\n> \n> It seems that we should have a utility method that would do this for us\n> somewhere in IPython.notebook.

    "body": "In my mind it isn't a question of doing the same thing a different way, but\nof refactoring the code to decouple these types of dependencies out of it.\nIn this case, the only part of the code base that show know anything about\nthe DOM elements of cells are the cell views. That part of the DOM tree\nshould be a private implementation detail of that view.\n\nThis is why starting with interfaces in the new code base is so important.\nThey specify a contract with other parts of the code base about what you\ncan and can't do with it.\n\nOur existing code base is a big tangled mess of things like this - it is\ngoing to be very difficult to decouple things in the existing notebook.\n\nBut as we design the new JS frontend, we are looking long and hard at this\ntype of coupling and trying to remove it in all cases. So far, I don't\nthink we have had to do this type of thing so that is a good sign.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 25, 2015 at 10:33 AM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I looked at the javascript, I don't see any simpler way to do it.\n> We _can_ discuss of a way to get a _probable_ handle on something like\n> the creator, I have no opposition to that.
