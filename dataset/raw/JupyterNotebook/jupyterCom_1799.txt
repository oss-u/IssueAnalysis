    "body": "@takluyver Thanks for the pointers, but I'm not sure about that temporary fix. It may do more harm than good, in case other Anaconda packages also depend on `gcc` or `libgcc`.\n\n@ccordoba12 Many thanks, hopefully @mingwandroid can shed some light on this.\n\nMore info: I uninstalled `stringi` from the baseline R library in my system. After that, I can open R notebooks in Jupyter without errors. However, I don't think that you should be forced to uninstall any package from the baseline R library in your system when the whole point of using Anaconda is basically to encapsulate all dependencies in your working environment.\n\nI have set up R with Jupyter notebooks in Anaconda many times previously (both in Linux and Windows). This is the first time I run into this problem. \n\nMy big doubt is: if Anaconda is (apparently) installing its own version of all R packages, aside from any other R installation in your system, why is there any conflict between `stringi` packages in both locations? It should only see what is installed _inside the Anaconda environment_. In fact, you don't need to follow IRkernel linking instructions anymore.\n\nThanks in advance for your help with this issue. I think this can be a serious problem, as it is very likely that many users willing work with R notebooks in Jupyter will also probably have R and RStudio already installed.\n",
