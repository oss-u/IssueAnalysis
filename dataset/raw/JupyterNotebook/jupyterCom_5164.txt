    "body": "Hi @averri - I don't have anything immediate to offer, just a couple questions and a suggestion.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you launch the notebook server with the `--debug` flag, as it may produce some additional insights.  The fact that the log is so silent is a little strange.  This seems to imply that the kernel is running, but you should see messaging relative to the kernel-info request/response - particularly that the response wasn't received - or something to the affect.\r\n\r\nWhat version of python are you using?  There are known issues with event loops on Windows 10 + py8 that exist in both Notebook and IPykernel, but you'd have typically encountered the Notebook form of the issue immediately.\r\n\r\nAre you using nb_conda_kernels?  This could explain why you didn't see the Win10/py8 event loop issue in Notebook, but it may be encountered in a conda env that is using py8.  Might that scenario fit your environment?\r\n\r\nSorry there's nothing concrete to offer here, but perhaps by adding `--debug` and getting an idea of your configuration, we can make some headway.",

I haven't seen anything relevant in the debug logs. \r\nThe same notebook is working fine with the Firefox browser, so I decided to disable Google Chrome browser plugins. After disabling the plugins, the problem is gone. This issue was related to a Google Chrome plugin interfering with the Jupyter Notebook JavaScript functions.",
