This may be as simple as adjusting your PATH, but if `conda` isn't found anywhere, then parts of your configuration have been corrupted and you might be better off updating conda.  (Not sure if there's a specific \"fix me\" command or not, but if 'conda' isn't available, you might need to uninstall/reinstall.)",
