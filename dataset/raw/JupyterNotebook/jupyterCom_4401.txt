    "body": "Newer user here, but I have dealt with some of this recently.  I suspect Jupyter's home directory is deeper into your local tree than you believe it to be.  Jupyter will, by default, start where its executable is sitting.  If you are in Windows, you could create a .bat (batch or shell script) file along these lines:\r\n\r\n\"C:\\install folder\\Jupyter Notebook.exe\" --no-browser --notebook-dir=\"C:/\"\r\n\r\nThen you can copy the link (like localhost:####longtoken)  from the command line window into a browser of your choice.  The notebook's home will be the directory at the end of the line above.  If you are in something besides Windows, search on similar terms for similar options.\r\n",
