This PR is a question of whether we should be persisting this UI state, which is not the same as what's discussed in the schema PR. i.e. are these flags ephemeral UI state or are they persistent properties of the notebook.\r\n\r\nAll of the discussion around persistent properties of notebooks involve proposing entirely new keys with new meanings that aren't these two, so any changes here are not really related to those under discussion elsewhere.",
