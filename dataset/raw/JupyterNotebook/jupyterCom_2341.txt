I think that makes sense for a _lot_ of usecases, and is immediately understandable.\r\n> \r\n> If you want to be able to import python files from another place, you could add that other directory to your `sys.path`. You could even put this into a small stub python file in the notebook directory and import it at the top of each notebook. For example, put this in `myfiles.py` in the same directory as the notebooks:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> import sys\r\n> import os\r\n> sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../python')))\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> and then in the notebook, just do `import myfiles`. That will set up the path so that you can import your python files.\r\n\r\nIt's sad that there is no configuration for the author's case. I have the same actually and a lot of notebook files where I don't want to put these lines (in the top of each of them) :disappointed: ",
