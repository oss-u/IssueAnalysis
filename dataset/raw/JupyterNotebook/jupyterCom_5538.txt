    "body": "Hi @Carreau - thanks for raising this issue.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think its too soon to drop 3.6 and would rather we adhere to the general python-support timeframes: https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches\r\n\r\nThe Notebook 6.1.0 is in progress with rc1 released last week.  I think we could probably entertain dropping 3.5 from 6.1.0 given its end-of-life in a few months, but dropping 3.6 seems premature.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should add formal support for 3.8 and look at enabling testing for 3.9. (I'll look into this.)\r\n\r\nWhat do others think wrt to 3.5 and 3.6?",
