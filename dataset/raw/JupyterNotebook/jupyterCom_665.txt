Worse, the set to which these actions apply is state dependent. \n\nIf now I have to explain to someone what delete does, my answer need to start with: \"It depends\". Even worse if I look at a notebook I cannot tell what it will do. \nI have to scroll through the all notebook to see wether cells are marked or not. \nExample, see two gif attached. On which one will dd delete the selected cell ?\n\n![dno](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/10747452/6ebba7c2-7c12-11e5-98fc-1c9289ce6c80.gif)\n![dyes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/10747451/6ebb2fea-7c12-11e5-884d-7c1155e784d7.gif)\n\nBoth are on current master.\n",
