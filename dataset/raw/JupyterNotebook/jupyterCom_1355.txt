    "body": "We had many long discussions about whether to follow XDG for config on Linux, and ultimately decided against it. There was a period of time when IPython followed XDG, but people found it more confusing that the location varied across platforms (XDG is inappropriate on OS X and Windows, for instance), and reverted back to consistently using `~/.ipython`. Following that experience, we decided against adopting XDG for config in Jupyter. We do follow XDG for data/runtime files.\n\nIf you prefer XDG behavior, you can set:\n\n```\nJUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/jupyter\n```\n\nand it should work how you like.\n",
