I get the impression that our system of only allowing access to the starting folder and subfolders is not well understood.

I like Matthias's idea of showing the root of the notebook server in the same manner as the file browser itself. I know it isn't standard, but at least consistent.\r\n* Even for non file system content managers, they will still have the notion of paths, so I think they would show the same type of thing as the file browser does.\r\n* I am fine using forward slashes even on windows.",

I'm not clear why the root directory of the server should be secret.\r\n  - So long as our other security measures are working, only the authenticated user can see this anyway; we're not broadcasting it to the internet.\r\n  - We avoid *serving files* from outside the server root directory to make it marginally trickier for someone who can bypass those security mechanisms to read e.g. ssh keys. This has always been somewhat doubtful as a security mechanism, and I don't think that it's worth 'protecting' the information of which directory the server is serving like this.\r\n  - It's no less protected than the list of files in that directory, which seems more likely to contain sensitive information than the path.\r\n  - +1 to compressing the user's home directory to `~` as @Carreau suggested - does that make it more tolerable?\r\n2. We already show the path from the server root directory in the move dialog. We're discussing this because we're concerned that it's not obvious to users how these paths work.
