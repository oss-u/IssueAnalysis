In docker it can, or at least does not exist a easy way to do so on LXD / LXC. There are many threads about this issue on the internet and I could not find any viable solution.\r\n\r\nWhen notebook==5.5.0rc1 showed up, translating ip into domain names / machine names, every time notebook become online i get this address **http://container:8888/** that I cannot access by name unless I start to managing it into my /etc/hosts or remembering the original IP number from before.\r\n\r\nWhat do you propose ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "So I've just tried it locally, and I think maybe it's more robust to change this logic:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# What we have now:\r\nif self.ip in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', hostname):\r\n    ip = self.ip\r\nelse:\r\n    ip = hostname\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Proposed\r\nif self.ip in ('', '0.0.0.0'):\r\n    ip = hostname\r\nelse:\r\n    ip = self.ip\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. prefer the IP address where a meaningful one was specified, since that's potentially more likely to work from other machines, but use the hostname when we don't have a meaningful IP address, which is @evandam's use case.",
