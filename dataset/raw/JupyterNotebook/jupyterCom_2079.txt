This is probably a job for IPython's completions, and may be addressed by the upcoming switch to jedi in IPython 6.\r\n\r\nI had this enabled on jedi in terminal for some time.\r\nThat's actually annoying in many case, because assigning a method/function is a valid operation in python. As is passing a callback, like in filter, map, or many other case.\r\nSo you end up being annoyed by the extra parens even if it's 1 backspace away.\r\nAdding the closing parens would be annoying to, an you would have to press left arrow once. The current completion API does not allow to reposition the cursor.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to (re)give it a try though.  ",
