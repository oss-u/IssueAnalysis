    "body": "> There have been some requests to translate in general, and proposal for RTL\r\n\r\nGreat. Even the fact I am using a well mirrored software (MediaWiki) on every day basis, as a programmer, I personally don't see much value on making jupyter completely translated to have a RTL UI. However, I understand and appreciate the efforts there. I like to add that I see only one real and effective way making a currently LTR UI to RTL, and that is use of a CSS mirror tool, like [R2](https://github.com/ded/R2) or [CSSJanus](https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus), described [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Features#Flipping) (reading this will be very insightful, specially the excepting rule part). Also [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Dir&action=edit) is a complete list of RTL languages are listed that you probably like to complete isMirroringEnabled function there, \"ar|arc|arz|azb|bcc|ckb|bqi|dv|fa|glk|he|kk-arab|kk-cn|ks|ku-arab|mzn|pnb|ps|sd|ug|ur|ydd|yi\".\r\n\r\n> Would that be on a per-cell basis ? Or on all notebook ? with a better understanding we might be able to pull that off.\r\n\r\nJust per result cells. That would be really super useful. For example you are doing a RTL web scraping  thing and you just want to see a part of the page\\ in RTL.\r\n\r\nOne other good to have RTL support feature is applying dir=\"auto\" to all languages markdown paragraph, like what I did on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/6296",
