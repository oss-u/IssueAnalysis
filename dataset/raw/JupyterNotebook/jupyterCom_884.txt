    "body": "> I cannot find the part of the code that is causing this behavior. I thought that it was lines 1612 and 1616 in the Notebook.prototype.merge_cells function of notebook/notebook/static/notebook/js/notebook.js, but when I modified this in my local copy to remove the two newline characters from the join, it didn't seem to have any effect.\n\nYou need to [rebuild the Javascript or use the `--NotebookApp.ignored_minified_js=True`](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development_js.html?highlight=ignore_minified_js#installing-javascript-machinery) forchanges to JS files to take effect. \n\nYou can also already change the behavior of the notebook by rebinding \"merge cell\" to your own command (that does not include the `\\n`) if you like. The number of small configuration option like that is so huge that we will likely not implement them all. \n\nPR welcomed though. \n",
