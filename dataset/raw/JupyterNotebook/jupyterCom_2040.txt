It's like giving a child cigarettes: sure, they should be able to choose to partake in a harmful activity when they're old enough to know what they're doing, but when you start them on it at a young age, they're dependent for life, and completely helpless when they can't get their fix.\r\n\r\nIt should be disabled _by default_, or for god's sake at least provide an easy way to turn it off.\r\n\r\nOr as OP suggested: remove the feature altogether and make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nAnyways, rant over.
