    "body": "Thanks for taking interest in this issue. I think you may have read the post a bit too fast : I am not using multiprocessing (I am well aware of its issues in interactive interpreter on Windows) but rather multiprocess, a fork of multiprocessing replacing pickle by dill for the serialization (see [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27932987/multiprocessing-package-in-interactive-python) with the answer from the multiprocess author). This works very well in an ipython console (built-in multiprocessing does not) so I thought this would translate to the notebook but it does not. I guess that, if you could point me to differences between the ipython console and notebook interpreters, I might be able to find a workaround. BTW, this is not a critical issue, but rather a nice side benefit that I was hoping to get from going with multiprocess.\n",
