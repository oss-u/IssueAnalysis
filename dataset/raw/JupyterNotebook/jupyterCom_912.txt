    "body": "I am not sure what the fix is, but I see roughly where the problem is:\n- In `tornado>=4` there is a `WebSocketHandler.check_origin(self, origin)` method that checks the origin of web sockets. It has a required positional argument.\n- In jupyter/notebook, we have a subclass that we use in our handlers `ZMQStreamHandler(WebSocketMixin, WebSocketHandler)` which also has the `check_origin` method with the required positional.\n- In terminado there is `TermSocket(tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler)` which has a `check_origin` method with an _optional_ `keyword argument`.\n- In `TermSocket.open` `self.check_origin()` is called with no arguments.\n- At first glance this looks like it should work fine because it will be calling terminado's subclasses `check_origin`.\n- _But_, the code which calls open in juipyter/notebook does so by doing `super(WebSocketMixin, self).open(*args, **kwargs)`.\n- Somehow, that is causing the base tornado `check_origin` to be called, but with _no arguments_, which results in an exception.\n\nThe part that I am still confused about is that `WebSocketMixin` doesn't have the base tornado `WebSocketHandler` in its mro, so I don't see how it is resolving to that.\n\nQuestions:\n- All of this logic in terminado is to handle tornado<4. But tornado 3 is really old now and jupyter/notebook now requires tornado>=4. Can we just remove all this logic from terminado?\n- Is there something more subtle going on with the inheritance here that needs to be fixed?\n- The tornado `check_origin` method has never had a different signature. Buy terminado subclassing and changing the signature, this was bound to happen at some point. If we keep the logic in terminado,  can we address this API difference?\n\n@minrk @takluyver \n",
