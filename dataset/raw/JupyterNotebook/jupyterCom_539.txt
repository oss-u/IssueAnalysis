    "body": "@jdfreder @jasongrout @roger- I looked at the current state of the code and it appears there are explicit declarations in Jupyter notebook turning off auto-capitalization:\n\n``` bash\nâžœ  notebook git:(master) egrep -rl 'autocapitalize.*off' * | egrep -v '\\.js\\.map' | while read file ; do egrep -Hn 'autocapitalize.*off' $file ; done\nnotebook/static/tree/js/main.min.js:1270:    field.setAttribute(\"autocapitalize\", \"off\");\nnotebook/static/edit/js/main.min.js:1270:    field.setAttribute(\"autocapitalize\", \"off\");\nnotebook/static/notebook/js/main.min.js:1270:    field.setAttribute(\"autocapitalize\", \"off\");\nnotebook/static/components/codemirror/lib/codemirror.js:1180:    field.setAttribute(\"autocapitalize\", \"off\");\nnotebook/static/terminal/js/main.min.js:7163:    field.setAttribute(\"autocapitalize\", \"off\");\n```\n\nAll of which are using the same function, `disableBrowserMagic` with this value.\n\nA notable caveat is that some of the code, all tokens of this case are shown above, are being used right now has the value 'off' for `autocapitalize`, however looking at the [developer manual for Safari Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/Attributes.html) this is deprecated in favor of using the value 'none' since iOS 5.0.  The [equivalent state](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/04/autocapitalize?hl=en) appears to be in recent versions of Android Chrome. I don't know enough about this but a simple PR changing 'off' to 'none' maybe all that's necessary to rectify this issue, but well as you know many of those JavaScript files are thousands of loc so who knows, but it might be worth a try.\n\n@roger- This being the case note the mobile support is still at this time experimental in CodeMirror, and was only officially experimentally supported February of this year, note the [release history](http://codemirror.net/doc/releases.html) for version 5.0.  [This](http://codemirror.net/#browsersupport) is the list of their officially supported browsers, all desktop versions. \n\nSecondly if one does a [search on the GitHub repository of CodeMirror for 'keyboard'](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+keyboard) there are currently 7 open issues 5 of which are mobile platform related. \n\nThe project appears to be actively working on becoming more compatible with mobile browsers, and I will certainly benefit as my portable device of choice is an Android tablet. Note at least on my Android tablet the hardware (bluetooth) keyboard I use with it doesn't auto-capitalize the first inputted letter like the virtual keyboard does.  For my and potentially your workflow using a hardware keyboard is a reasonable stopgap, but of course what mobile OS, what OS version, as well as browser used on each may radically change the actual behavior observed between different mobile setups.\n\nEdit: Ah these JavaScript files are being generated in the build process.  Someone more knowledgeable than I will likely need to find where.\n",
