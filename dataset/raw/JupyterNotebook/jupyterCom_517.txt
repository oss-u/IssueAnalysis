I've spent multiple hours researching this problem, but there doesn't seem to be a satisfactory solution:\r\n\r\nExtensions like \"it's all text\" don't work with jupyter cells.\r\n\r\nThe [snippet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28309430/edit-ipython-cell-in-an-external-editor) mentioned above is a good start, but it has some serious problems.  It executes code directly in the kernel and thus has side effects (setting the `f` global variable, importing the `os` module) that could break actual notebook code in ways that are difficult to understand.  It also relies on actually having a Python kernel running, while Jupyter is a more general project.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to run Python code from Javascript not in the kernel but in the ipython instance that is actually running jupyter?  How to pass values to and from java script?  If I had answers to these questions, I believe that I could come up with a nice way of launching external editors.\r\n",
