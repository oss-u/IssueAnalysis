    "body": "@sharanbr - I suspect the issue is that your ML program file `D:\\Users\\sharanb\\OneDrive - HCL Technologies Ltd\\Projects\\MyBackup\\Projects\\Initiatives\\machine learning\\programs\\six.py` is interfering/conflicting with IPython's ability to invoke `import six` and its importing your `six.py` - which contains Python 2 code, etc.  \r\n\r\nTry renaming `D:\\Users\\sharanb\\OneDrive - HCL Technologies Ltd\\Projects\\MyBackup\\Projects\\Initiatives\\machine learning\\programs\\six.py` to a slightly different name.\r\n\r\n> Also, a week back this was all working fine.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your `six.py` has been recently introduced?  That particular import statement has been present in `traitlets.py` for more than 4 years, so I'm going with the first theory.",

That exactly was the issue. \r\nI have uninstalled and installed at least 4 times since last 2 days with various combinations assuming the issue would get resolved.\r\nNow, the issue is resolved. I tried a couple of examples. Who would have thought.\r\n\r\nNow, one thing that is very surprising to me.\r\nsix.py is not a new file. It was created in 2018 apparently.\r\nThe same jupyter was working a few days back. The issue came up all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks a lot.",

    "body": "I wonder if something in IPython or IPykernel has changed in how it scopes files. Looks like [`ipykernel`](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/releases/tag/5.1.4) was released a few weeks ago to address a Windows/py3.8 issue so maybe something in your env triggered its upgrade.  Perhaps attempting to revert ipykernel to `5.1.3` (at the risk of sliding down a slippery slope) to see if your situation resolves again would be a good data point?  It's up to you.  Glad you're able to move forward.",
