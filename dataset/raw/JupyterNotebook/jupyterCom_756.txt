    "body": "This is an inconsistency in how pandoc and marked handle invalid pipe-tables. It might be considered a bug in pandoc that it trims the columns (as opposed to throwing a render error, due to invalid markup), but I'm not sure you can rely on handling of invalid input to be consistent across different tools. It would probably be better to show an error, rather than silently ignoring the bug in the markdown input.\n\nSince the two libraries responsible for this rendering are external dependencies (marked/mistune and pandoc), I don't think there's anything for us to do here.\n",
