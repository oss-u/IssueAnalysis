I know we're still thinking about giving kernel code more access to some kind of frontend information, but until we've worked out something coherent, I think it's preferable not to provide this kind of information.\n\nIt can probably be misused in the terminal too - e.g. the 'open a new browser window' trick only works if you're on localhost. But without HTML output, I think there's much less opportunity for mischief.\n",
