    "body": "Thanks for checking.  Yeah, the notebook server believes the session is now stale and closes it.  \r\n\r\nIf prior log statements aren't \"interesting\", it might be helpful to enable debug (`--debug`) and reproduce it.  Based on the [code comment](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/kernels/handlers.py#L247-L249), it sounds like there was a lost network connection on the client side, but I'm not familiar with the session-to-kernel relationship.\r\n\r\nThe kernel restart failure is purely due to the kernelmanager no longer having a record of the kernel in its active list - which led me down the culling path.  This could also happen if the kernel was shutdown, or you're now targeting a different notebook server (unlikely - especially since it had a record of your session).\r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more helpful at this point.  Perhaps someone else has ideas?",
