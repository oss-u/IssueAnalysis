    "body": "Wow, that is fantastic progress. A few questions:\n\nWhat is meant by \"Community Documentation?\" Is that what we are using to\nrefer to all our docs, or just part of the docs that non-core devs wrote?\n\nOriginally the notebook based documentation was supposed to be _the_\ndocumentation for the notebook - at least that is how I wrote it initially.\nThe only problem is that we didn't delete the other sphinx docs so now we\nhave things repeated in multiple places. Have we started to deduplicate the\ncontent so that content is only in one place or the other rather than both?\n\nKids are here this week, so I won't have much of a chance to do an in depth\nreview, so I would merge and we can iterate further.\n\nCheers, and great work!\n\nOn Wed, Mar 23, 2016 at 8:46 PM, Carol Willing notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Closes #1250 https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1250 #1251\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1251 #1252\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1252\n> \n> I think this incorporates all the desired changes that @carreau\n> https://github.com/carreau wanted in these issues and PRs:\n> - Removed rst versions of notebooks\n> - notebooks build using nbsphinx\n> - Removed the Examples index notebook and replaced with a rst version\n>   since linking from notebook to notebook was not working on RTD\n> - Fixed the Typesetting equations notebook so that it now displays the\n>   rendered math on RTD [image: :tada:]\n> - Fixed a bunch of the notebooks including: to avoid segfaulting\n>   sphinx, to use py3 for all nbs, to avoid using multiple H1 in notebooks so\n>   contents render more neatly\n> - Gotten rid of all warnings except one pesky one\n> - Added notebook extensions back to the TOC.\n> - Updated conda yaml to environment.yml\n> \n> Here's a rendered version on RTD\n> http://testnb.readthedocs.org/en/new-build/examples/Notebook/Typesetting%20Equations.html\n> .\n> \n> _Visual of Master Table of Contents_\n> [image: screen shot 2016-03-23 at 8 29 03 pm]\n> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2680980/14007828/95364840-f137-11e5-989a-903a5ce8a050.png\n> \n> _Visual of example notebooks table of contents_\n> [image: screen shot 2016-03-23 at 8 29 24 pm]\n> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2680980/14007829/9536556a-f137-11e5-9a20-448c1180599a.png\n> \n> I spent way too long on this but it fixes a bunch of loose ends that have\n> bugged me for a while.\n> \n> @carreau https://github.com/carreau, @minrk https://github.com/minrk,\n> \n> ## @ellisonbg https://github.com/ellisonbg Please review.
