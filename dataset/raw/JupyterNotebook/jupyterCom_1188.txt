It's still a lot to scroll (first up to the tab, then shutdown the  notebook, then back to the filetree and there scroll down to the open another notebook :-/), but most of it is gone... I would still find a dropdown or button in the file based view more usefull.\n\nFun, I never even realized that tab was there, probably because I once explored these tabs and they were useless for me on windows (terminal) and without a cluster. I never realized the open notebooks were moved there as well.\n",
