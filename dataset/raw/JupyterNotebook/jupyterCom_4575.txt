Found that multiple \"Page Unresponsive\" dialogs were in encountered (Chrome) in the course of launching a kernel where the delay appeared to be in the rendering of the directories (not in their retrieval).  However, this is much better behaved (i.e., tolerable) using Jupyter Lab.  Since the two share the same backend and Lab is considered the future frontend, I'm not sure how much traction this issue will get at this point.  \r\n\r\nIs Jupyter Lab an option for you?",
