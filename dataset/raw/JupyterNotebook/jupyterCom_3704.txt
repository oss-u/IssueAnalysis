    "body": "Hi @yujund, I don't think there's anything to resolve here, at least that's obvious.  I personally cannot reproduce the issue and suspect there's a disconnect somewhere.  Perhaps you could share your expectation?\r\n\r\nHere's what I just did...\r\nFrom a MacOS terminal window, I set an environment variable named `ISSUE` to `3704` and launch notebook\r\n```bash\r\nexport ISSUE=3704\r\njupyter notebook\r\n```\r\nI then start a python kernel and access the environment variable from the cell...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22599560/91240603-54120880-e6f7-11ea-97ad-dcd2a94c37de.png)\r\n\r\nSame goes for `.bashrc`.  Unless it's sourced _prior_ to launching the Notebook server, any environment variables exported in `.bashrc` are not available to a launched kernel.  Sure, if I create a sub-shell using `bash`, then `.bashrc` is sourced by that action and you _should_ see those variables from the kernel (I do), but the act for running `jupyter notebook` or launching a kernel, does _source_ a new shell. As a result, the behavior should be the following - which I believe is consistent across all responses:\r\n\r\n_Whatever environment you have when launching the Notebook server, is the environment you should see from within a launched kernel._\r\n\r\nThere are some variations to this and you'll see differences with the following:\r\n1. You're using a Gateway server - which only propagates the server's env via configuration.\r\n2. You've added an `env` stanza to your kernel's `kernel.json` file, in which case you'll see **additional** environment variables in your kernel's environment.\r\n3. You're actually launching a shell script from which you can do anything to set up your kernel's env prior to invoking the kernel from that script.",
