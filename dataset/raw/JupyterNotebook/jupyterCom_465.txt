We want these actions to be super\nfast and automatic. In a given notebook, it is also likely that a user will\nusing the same restart logic repeatedly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is a thought:\n- Offer a single restart menu item and button.\n- Bring up a modal dialog that has only two buttons (Restart, Cancel)\n- Expose the different restart options (Clear Output, Run All) as\n  checkboxes in the dialog.\n- And here is the _important_ part - for each notebook sessions, remember\n  the user's last selection of those checkboxes.\n\nBenefits:\n- Easy/quick to scan the checkbox options visually.\n- Those options are separate from the main choice to restart.\n- Once a user picks the right options, they can restart extremely fast with\n  \"00 return\".\n\nOn Sun, Sep 20, 2015 at 7:42 AM, Carol Willing notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @minrk https://github.com/minrk I'll do a bit of thinking on this.\n> \n> In general, \"Restart & Run All\" is not feeling specific enough to me when\n> placed under \"Kernel\" menu.

I use Restart & Run All as a verification process, to ensure my notebook is in a good state, but that's only when I'm in a final review process of a notebook that I am about to share. I don't do it other than that. To me, that points to them being completely separate actionsâ€”separate dialogs, etc.â€”but obviously I'm not necessarily a representative user, and @ellisonbg's definitely right that user testing would be helpful here.\n",
