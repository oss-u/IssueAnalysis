    "body": "My guess would be the iframe in the `/view/` handler. When you request `/view/n/img/Energy-density.jpg`, the response is a small HTML page containing a sandboxed iframe, within which the browser will make a new request for `/files/n/img/Energy-density.jpg` (which serves the actual image). The sandboxing means that the browser treats the iframe itself as a separate domain, so we get cross-origin protections. That's important because otherwise viewing an HTML file would let it execute code through a kernel. But I bet it also means that the browser sees the cookies it's sending to the notebook server as 'third party' cookies, because they're not tied to the sandbox domain.\r\n\r\nIn principle, we only need the sandboxing for file types that can run JS in the browser, like HTML. So we could reduce the impact by not using the iframe for images. But I don't know exactly what that set is - can SVG run JS? Are there other HTML-like types that the browser might display? And I don't see how we can avoid the third-party cookie issues for viewing HTML files.",
