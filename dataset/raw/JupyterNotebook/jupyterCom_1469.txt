I hope then we can more easily see what needs to be adapted to fit jupyterlab, assuming we want to enable the idea of bundlers there too as well.\n\nI believe the server side is pretty agnostic as to the UI. The client side JS will surely need translation to fit jupyterlab vs the current notebook.\n",
