It would be important that raw access provide/preserve the appropriate mimetype for any given file.\n\nIf one chooses to click the edit button for a file that the editor can't load, I imagine there's some type of exception that the editor can/does throw when it tries to load it, which could be caught and an appropriate error-message displayed, superimposed on the editor-area of the edit page (instead of the file-folder navigation page).\n\nI think this would also lend itself to the editor context being more pluggable, e.g. it could be possible at some point (via custom configuration/scripts) to invoke an editor such as [DarkroomJS](https://mattketmo.github.io/darkroomjs/) rather than the default text editor when the file being loaded has an image mimetype. If logic in the the file-folder navigation context is trying to decide what's edit-able, it seems like it would just get in the way or require adjustments in multiple places.\n",

The PR will focus on fixing the edit functionality on the file tree. \n\nWhile I think the \"Raw\" button is a good feature for some, I think it should probably be provided as an extension to the Notebook instead of a baked-in feature. Most users are used to downloading raw files using File > Download interface and an extra button to accomplish the same thing might be confusing for some.\n\nSince making notebook extensions is my new obsession, I opened up a repository for it [here](https://github.com/captainsafia/raw-button). I think I should have something for you by Thursday night, @michaelsbradleyjr.\n",
