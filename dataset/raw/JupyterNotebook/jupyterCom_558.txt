I love the immediate\n> feedback, especially.\n> In reviewing the search and replace, here are some issues I'm seeing:\n> - The joke in the regexp tooltip (\"Now you have N+1 Problems\") is\n>   funny to me, but not appropriate for this interface, I think. On the other\n>   hand, it would be extremely helpful if the regexp tooltip said it was using\n>   javascript regexp syntax\n> - selecting multiple cells, and then clicking Edit | Find and Replace\n>   deselects all but one cell. Thus the \"Replace in selected cells\" is much\n>   less useful\n> \n> 窶能n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/558.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
