    "body": "I am also experiencing the same issue using a fresh install of Miniconda3 on Windows 7. I installed Miniconda 3 for all users then created a user-specific kernel named `psi-dev-1` and installed it using `python -m ipykernel install --user --name psi-dev-1`. The kernel loads fine, and I can run basic Python statements. However, when I attempt `import numpy`, I get the following traceback:\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-d4cdadb62aa7> in <module>\r\n----> 1 import numpy\r\n\r\n~\\.conda\\envs\\psi-dev-1\\lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n    138 \r\n    139     # Allow distributors to run custom init code\r\n--> 140     from . import _distributor_init\r\n    141 \r\n    142     from . import core\r\n\r\n~\\.conda\\envs\\psi-dev-1\\lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\_distributor_init.py in <module>\r\n     32 \r\n     33 with RTLD_for_MKL():\r\n---> 34     from . import _mklinit\r\n     35 \r\n     36 del RTLD_for_MKL\r\n\r\nImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote in the paths above, it's using the `psi-dev-1` environment for Numpy. However, when I install numpy into the base conda environment,  it starts working.
