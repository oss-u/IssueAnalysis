    "body": "@takluyver \r\n\r\nInteresting, yes, the available width is changing. It appears to be related to me having  changed the default Windows taskbar location to put it on the right side. If you look at the image above, there appear to be two vertical scrollbars on the right side of each notebook. The inner one is useful, and the outer one appears to be a UI bug that is triggered by putting the windows taskbar on the right.\r\n\r\nThe left window always has two vertical scrollbars (so seems to have a display bug). The right window normally has only one, but **a second one appears during the checkpoint save operation**.\r\n\r\nIf I swap the left and right windows, so I'm editing a notebook in the left size, then there are always two scrollbars, so this additional vertical jump during checkpoint save (my # 2 above), does not occur.\r\n\r\nIf I move the taskbar location to the bottom of the screen, then both windows have only a single scrollbar (so normal expected behavior), and again my # 2 above does not occur.",
