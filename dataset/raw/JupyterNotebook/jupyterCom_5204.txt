    "body": "Hi @zengzhengrong, this strikes me as more of a k8s deployment issue for how its configured to mount directories into your container.\r\n\r\nBased on your screen shots and a google search, I suspect you're hitting this issue: https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/13124 which is due to the [dask helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/dask) using a config map to introduce configuration into the container.  And that appears to be a kubernetes issue where [configMap destinations become read-only](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62099) as a means to address a [different issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60814).  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this could be used as a workaround, but you can affect the locations for configuration, runtime and data files by [setting the appropriate environment variables](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/jupyter-directories.html).  These can then be pointed to more \"static\" locations within the image itself.  Of course, this would imply that any data from the configMap would likely be ignored.\r\n\r\nYou might also checkout [Enterprise Gateway](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is essentially Kernel Gateway with the ability to launch remote kernels in their own pods, etc., and offers [images for use on Kubernetes](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway).  This may be more than what you need for your vscode integration, but I thought I'd toss it out there.\r\n",
