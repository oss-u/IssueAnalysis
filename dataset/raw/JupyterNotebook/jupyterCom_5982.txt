    "body": "Hi @Bambillo1, thanks for opening this issue. This doesn't appear to be an issue with Jupyter Notebook; rather, it might be an issue with how anaconda installed Jupyter.\r\n\r\nWe suggest posting your question on [Jupyter's Discourse page](https://discourse.jupyter.org/), where you're likely to receive more timely feedback/help. Remember to paste any output from your prompt in the post to help with diagnosing your issue. Thank you!",
