I hope these findings are helpful.\n\nIt throws an error here https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/tree/handlers.py#L43\n\nThe end reason is on this line: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/utils.py#L135, which is called (I believe) here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/contents/filemanager.py#L154\n\nI think that the line\n\n```\npath = path.strip('/')\n```\n\nmight need to be replaced by:\n\n```\npath = path.strip(os.sep)\n```\n\nso that it works on windows too. Indeed, is_hidden('C:') works fine (attrs is 22), whereas is_hidden('C:\\') fails (attr is 22)\n\nJust above here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/notebookapp.py#L871, it's may be needed to add the following two lines:\n\n```\n # Start by normalizing the path, otherwise checking if equal to os.sep will fail\n value = os.path.normpath(value)\n```\n\nSo far with this it still won't work, not sure why\n",

It seems that it finds my D: drive to be hidden (even if I passed 'D:' to it), I think because I have a single hidden directory. I use Box Sync, and I have a hidden `.boxsync` directory as a result.\n\nI think as a temporary workaround I'll force is_hidden to return False all the time.\n",
