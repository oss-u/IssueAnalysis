    "body": "One measure I've been thinking about for a while is having a form of one-time-password for the notebook. This would be randomly generated, and when it launched the browser to view the notebook, it would supply it in the URL, where it would be exchanged for a more persistent access token (via a cookie?).\n\nThis would make it more palatable to enable security measures like this by default, because it doesn't require any extra effort from the user.\n\nOf course, it still adds some inconvenience if the user wants to e.g. open up the notebook in a different browser. We could generate a code for them to copy and paste in that case. But that's inconveniencing 5% of use, rather than requiring a password typed in and inconveniencing all use.\n",
