    "body": "Thanks for the quick answer. Since it wasn't quite the answer I was hoping for, I had another look at RFC 3986.\r\n\r\nIs this the relevant source?\r\n\r\nIf yes, I'm now quite sure that the current form `attachment://myfile.png` is **invalid**!\r\n\r\nA double slash can only appear together with a (possibly empty) host name, but in this case, the path has to be absolute or empty (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3).\r\n\r\nUsing three slashes `attachment:///myfile.png` would be syntactically possible, but I guess in our case an absolute path doesn't make sense. And three slashes look ridiculous. But this is actually the not so uncommon case of `file:///my/absolute/file.txt`.\r\n\r\nHere's the syntax definition of RFC 3986 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A):\r\n\r\n```\r\nURI           = scheme \":\" hier-part [ \"?\" query ] [ \"#\" fragment ]\r\n\r\nhier-part     = \"//\" authority path-abempty\r\n              / path-absolute\r\n              / path-rootless\r\n              / path-empty\r\n\r\nURI-reference = URI / relative-ref\r\n\r\nabsolute-URI  = scheme \":\" hier-part [ \"?\" query ]\r\n\r\nrelative-ref  = relative-part [ \"?\" query ] [ \"#\" fragment ]\r\n\r\nrelative-part = \"//\" authority path-abempty\r\n              / path-absolute\r\n              / path-noscheme\r\n              / path-empty\r\n\r\nscheme        = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" )\r\n\r\nauthority     = [ userinfo \"@\" ] host [ \":\" port ]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npath-rootless = segment-nz *( \"/\" segment )\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nsegment-nz    = 1*pchar\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI initially thought the `relative-ref` is what we need, but this doesn't have a `scheme`!\r\n\r\nI guess what we want is plain old `URI`. The `scheme` part and the colon should be obvious, and for the `hier-part` there is only one option that fits in our case, namely `path-rootless`.\r\n\r\nSo if I'm not mistaken and if RFC 3986 is indeed the relevant source, the double slash is not allowed and the correct way to spell it would be\r\n\r\n    attachment:myfile.png\r\n\r\n... which IMHO is much less confusing and simply looks better.\r\n",
