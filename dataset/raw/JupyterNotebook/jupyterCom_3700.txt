    "body": "@jasongrout shared a bunch of relevant wisdom in comments [here](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3835)\r\n\r\nI personally wish the `editable` metadata flag, which I guess some extensions (and nbgrader?) use, were also documented in [the current official docs](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata).     Both Jupyter classic and JupyterLab do indeed prevent \"editing\" of the cell.  But the meaning of \"editing\" a cell is ambiguous, which is why it would be nice to document a choice... since I am implementing this for CoCalc.com, and have to make a choice.    For example, I did a quick check, and it seems to me that if a cell has `{editable:false}` then in Jupyter classic it **cannot** be deleted, but in JupyterLab it **can** be deleted.   Which should I choose?   (I'm choosing the Jupyter classic behavior, which seems more likely to be what end users expect, though it is less flexible.)",
