    "body": "@franckchen I'm not sure this fixes your original issue. This still won't allow you to delete the soft link... It will just throw an error that the directory doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nI think there are two possible directions to go here:\r\n\r\n1. If it is a soft link, but it's broken, return an error saying the link can't be deleted by the contents API. Try removing the link directly on the server.\r\n2. Enable the contents API to remove the symbolic link even if it's broken. \r\n\r\nWe can detect if the link is broken with some chunk like:\r\n```python \r\nif not os.path.exists(os.readlink(path)):\r\n    ...\r\n    # Raise error or remove.\r\n```",
