    "body": "Yes, I'd like it in core. Ideally students shouldn't have to install anything extra.\n\n> By read-only, I suppose you want users to not be able to clear output, and not modify the text of cell. \n\nI would be ok with clearing output -- just not editing the source of the cell. I think not being able to clear the output (or overwrite it, if the cell is re-run) could be confusing.\n\n> Can they enter edit mode for markdown cell, or just see the rendered version ? \n\nI think they should probably be able to see the source of markdown, just not edit it.\n\n> Should they be allowed to select the text ? (Codemirror as 2 read-only option: readOnly:true|'nocursor')\n\nI think disabling the cursor would be fine.\n\n> Copy the cell ? \n> Past it ? \n> If pasted, is the new cell read-only too ? Or not ?\n\nYes, it should be copiable, and pasted versions shouldn't be read-only. I would expect the behavior to be similar to how the \"undeletable\" property is maintained (and actually, \"read-only\" should imply \"undeleteable\", I think).\n",
