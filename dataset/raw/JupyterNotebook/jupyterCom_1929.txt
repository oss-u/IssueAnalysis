Given the difficulty of noticing this as mentioned in the [sphinx docs](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.9/markup/code.html#directive-code-block) I'm going to suggest that we switch to using `code-block::` rather than using `sourcecode::` just as that is more standard & widely used and easier to find at when searching the internet for resources related to potential documentation bugs.
