At least odd enough to open an issue the first time I encounter this situation.\r\nIt's not a big deal or showstopper in any way. But if you could change your deployment procedure (without much effort) so that new release candidates don't hide the last stable release, I'd appreciate it. \r\n\r\nMaybe PyPI has an option to create new releases as hidden, so that the previously visible version remains visible? Imho, that would be suitable for release candidates. Users interested in the latest release candidate could still find it tagged in GitHub, or mentioned on the Jupyter mailing list.
