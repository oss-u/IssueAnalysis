    "body": "@jdfreder The issue is that users have been using `d,d` to delete cells up until now, and if they encounter a case where there is a marked cell that is different from the selected cell, users are going to be surprised. Personally,\n\n> Deletes the selected cell, unless there are marked cells somewhere on the page, even if out of view.\n\nis very unintuitive to me. The cells that are being operated on are the ones I'm looking at. Since the few follows the selection around (not the marked cells), my first assumption would be that things like deleting cells operates on the one that I have selected, _especially_ if the marked cells aren't even visible.\n\nTo address the issue for now, I think the following two things will be sufficient:\n1. Always unmark cells after an operation (e.g. merge, split). Users aren't going to know how to unmark cells themselves (some will figure it out, many probably won't) so we shouldn't put them in a situation that will be confusing for them in the first place.\n2. (@Carreau 's suggestion) If, in the chance there is a marked cell somewhere, make sure that surprising behavior can't happen. Any destructive operations (merge, split, delete, etc.) should be disabled if the selected cell is not also a marked cell.\n",
