    "body": "Yes it makes help and sense and it works.\nThanks to both of you.\n\nFor the record, here is what I did:\n\n1/\nErase just about every file (not folder) in my .ipython directory for fear some remnant files from before the Big Split cause trouble.\n2/\nRun from terminal `ipython notebook --generate-config`. It failed until I re-created my default profile with `ipython profile create`. Then it worked. The `ipython notebook --generate-config` command created 2 config files: \n- .ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py\n- .ipython/profile_default/ipython_kernel_config.py  \n\n3/\nAdd `c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [ 'version_information']`to the first one. Putting this snippet in the second one, or not, did not seem to have an impact.\n\n4/ Re-start the kernel and the '%version_information' magic (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/version_information/blob/master/example.ipynb) I used was listed below `%lsmagic` and indeed available through `%version_information`.\n\n5/ My config:\n\n```\n$ conda list  | grep -E 'jupyter|ipython' \nipython                   4.0.1                    py27_0    defaults\nipython-genutils          0.1.0                     <pip>\nipython_genutils          0.1.0                    py27_0    defaults\njupyter                   1.0.0                    py27_1    defaults\njupyter_client            4.1.1                    py27_0    defaults\njupyter_console           4.0.3                    py27_0    defaults\njupyter_core              4.0.6                    py27_0    defaults\n```\n\nBy the way, I noticed that the folder 'extensions' in .ipython (surely a remnant) is empty and could be deleted without apparent consequences.\n\n(And congrats to all the people working on IPython & Jupyter - Very very useful !)\n",
