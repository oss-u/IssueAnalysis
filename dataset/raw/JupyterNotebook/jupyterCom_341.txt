    "body": "I need some help with this as it is driving me a little insane. So, I add the following line under the `get_default_command_shortcuts` function on the `KeyboardManager` prototype. \n\n`'shift-f': 'ipython.search-and-replace-dialog'`\n\nBut when I start up a test notebook to try it out, the `ShortcutManager` throughs an error because the action hasn't bee loaded yet. This error, `Uncaught Error: does not know how to deal with`, corresponds with [this line of code](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/336b3b7db6c9f9f0b2cfa07d4a26907ac3146838/notebook/static/base/js/keyboard.js#L365). I assume the error occurs because the `KeyboardManager` is created before `searchandreplace.load` can be called, causing the error.\n\nThe only solution that I could think of was changing the `load` function so that it acts directly on an `ActionManager` object as opposed to a `KeyboardManager` so that the process would look like this.\n1. `ActionManager` object is created.\n2. `searchandreplace.load` is called on `ActionManager` from 1.\n3. `KeyboardManager` object is created.\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me know if I am making this too complicated.\n",
