    "body": "It depends a bit on what exactly you want.\r\n\r\nNormally, the kernelspec manager lists all kernels that you have installed. You can remove kernelspecs from the system with `jupyter kernelspec remove NAME`. This will prevent them from showing up in the list.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make only specific kernels available but don't want to uninstall kernelspecs, you can set the kernelspec whitelist, which will filter out any installed kernelspecs not in the set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nc.KernelSpecManager.whitelist = {'julia-0.6', 'cling'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne extra bit is that Jupyter will include the 'default' kernel, that of the current Python that the notebook is running, even if the kernelspec is not installed. This is governed by `c.KernelSpecManager.ensure_native_kernel`. So if you set\r\n\r\n```python\r\nc.KernelSpecManager.ensure_native_kernel = False\r\n```\r\n\r\n*and* uninstall the default kernelspec, it won't show up but all others will.",
