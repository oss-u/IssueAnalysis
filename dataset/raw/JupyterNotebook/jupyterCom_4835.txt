Apologies for the delay—the state of the classic notebook is in limbo right now (see [this issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5360) and [the discussion](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/126#issuecomment-619251869) in last week's Jupyter Server meeting). We're working on better communication here for the state+future of the notebook. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can ping me here for review on this PR as you update on master (I can help along the way too—just let me know what you need). This is likely something we'll want to port over the Jupyter Server as soon as possible. We'd love to have you submit this work over there too, but I'm happy to cherry-pick the commits myself, if you're short on time. \r\n\r\nThank you, again, for all this great work!\r\n\r\n",
