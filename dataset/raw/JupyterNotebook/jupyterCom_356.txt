Where do I have to place these modules so nbconvert can find it? I've added to the config file\n\n``` python\nc.LatexExporter.filters = {'htmlimage': 'myfilter.htmlimage'}\n```\n\nand placed `myfilter.py` with the method htmlimage in the same directory as `mytemplate.tplx` but I always get the error _Could not construct Exporter: No module named myfilter_.\n",
