Without this change, you cannot click the scroll wheel (at least in Chrome on Linux). Focus will immediately switch to the editor and the completion box will disappear. With this patch, you can click-and-drag the scroll wheel.\n\n> With your patch after clicking a completion the notebook is in an inconsistent state. Keybinding are not working correctly, until a reach the mouse and click in a cell, and even though menu can get stuck.\n\nI'm not sure how to check for an inconsistent state, but I've added `that.editor.focus();` after `that.pick();` and it appears to fix the other issues.\n\nI understand if this is too much duct tape on duct tape to feel safe to include though.\n",
