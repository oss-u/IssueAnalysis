    "body": "Hi @willingc - thanks for the heads up.  \r\n\r\nI'm a little confused in trying to understand your comment from an urgency perspective.  Neither #4835 nor the fix I believe you're referring to (#5451) have been released - both in master waiting for their \"carrier\".  So was your py3 installation issue the result of cherry-picking #4853 (having not also taken #5451)?\r\n\r\nOur intention is to build 6.1 from master but if there's more at play here I suppose we could look into an interim patch release.  Although, having never built a notebook release, I should defer to Steve on that.\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest at least one rc release (for 6.1) so we can discover, and workout, any kinks as well.
