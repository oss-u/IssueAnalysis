HTML only for now.\r\n\r\nThat means you can't view a txt file (I think we should be able to, but faire enough for 5.0, it's always easy to add later, hard to remove).

    "body": "Broadly sounds sensible, but a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n> If known type, editable (txt, json, yaml, py, rb): \r\n> - button in toolbar show view\r\n\r\nI think it would be confusing if I select e.g. `.cson` and see an *Edit* button, but when I select `.txt` I don't. If we have a button that opens the text editor, it seems weird not to show it when files are likely to be text.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think should happen if I select files of multiple types simultaneously? E.g. if I select a `.ipynb`, a `.txt`, a `.png` and a `.cson`, presumably both *Edit* and *View* buttons will be visible? What happens if I click on each button? How many pages open up? Does the ipynb open in notebook view or in text view?\r\n\r\nAgain, it would seem weird if clicking *Edit* didn't open the editor for the `.txt` file, but it would also seem weird if the button wasn't there with only `.txt` selected, but was with `.txt` and `.cson`.\r\n\r\nFinally, anything based on the extension is a guess anyway - you can make `foo.png` a text file and `bar.txt` a binary file. I don't think we need to worry too much about those specific cases, but maybe it's helpful to know that we can't get this 100% right, because it feels like we're overthinking it a bit.",
