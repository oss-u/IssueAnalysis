    "body": "Thanks for opening this issue @AgrawalAmey.  I would love to be able to support multiple gateways and local kernels simultaneously but I think you'd need to tie kernel management with discovery (kernelspec management) - which is exactly the premise behind [_kernel providers_](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/45) which we hope to get into the [jupyter_server 2.x or 3.x release](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/112).\r\n\r\nWith kernel providers, we can support the various gateway kernels (Hadoop YARN, Kubernetes, Docker) directly via the jupyter server.  The kernel management portion of EG essentially goes away (although one would still have the ability to proxy all kernel management to a single gateway server, just not multiples, if they needed that separation).\r\n\r\n> should help a lot in enterprise settings where the user would have access to multiple clusters with different privileges/resources.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting on-prem clusters (e.g., Hadoop YARN), EG can support multiple clusters today via the process-proxy configuration settings (within the kernelspec). Not sure if that would help you or not.\r\n",
