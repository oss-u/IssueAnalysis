For instance, you can tag a cell with `nbval-check-output` to indicate that nbval should check the output. I also expected tags like `nbconvert-hide-code` to tell nbconvert to hide the input part of a cell.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I think these should be prefixed with the name of the tool, but I also think it's fine for us to define some general purpose ones which different tools can use, e.g. `raises-exception` to mark a cell where an error is expected.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of like the environment variable namespace:\r\n- You can use environment variables for any purpose,\r\n- It's usually good practice to prefix variable names, e.g. `PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\r\n- Some names have a generally agreed meaning, e.g. `PATH`\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables aren't conceptually beautiful, but they're easy to understand and you can get a lot done with them.
