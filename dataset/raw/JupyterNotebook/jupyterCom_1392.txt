You can try something like this:\n\n``` markdown\n* first item\n  * first subitem\n  * second subitem\n\n  paragraph after second subitem\n* second item\n\n  paragraph inside second item\n* third item\n```\n\nThe real problem, however, isn't only list spacing. The spacing of `<p>` and many other elements just doesn't work well together.\nSadly, I don't know enough CSS-fu to produce a solution for the whole problem, I hope somebody else does that!\n",
