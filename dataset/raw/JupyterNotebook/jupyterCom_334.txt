    "body": "Hmm, yeah, I don't know why it would be crashing -- I've never had an issue with that. A few thoughts, though not sure if any of these would actually be related:\n1. You probably don't want to run the container as root (i.e. you should probably define a user in it and then set the working directory to that user's home directory)\n2. You might want to have it listen to `0.0.0.0` rather than `*`\n\nI would have a look at how the `jupyter/singleuser` container is set up, which is used with JupyterHub (so you won't need e.g. the singleuser script, but the stuff it does in terms of creating a user and stuff might be relevant):\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/dockerspawner/blob/master/singleuser/Dockerfile\n\nI suppose though that docker container also uses `sh` to ultimately start the server so maybe that's why it works. Now that I think about it a bit more, I'm not actually sure I've tried to run the notebook directly from a container, it's always been from some script that did some additional setup first.\n",
