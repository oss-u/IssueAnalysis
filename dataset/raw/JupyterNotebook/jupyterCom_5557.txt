    "body": "Very strange.  I suspect there's some notebook kernel still running that is tying up the shutdown process.  Since this scenario is expensive to test (time-wise), I would recommend first ensuring the notebook server is completely shut down prior to rebooting your mac.  If you're using ipykernel (the python kernel), I think you could say things are completely shutdown if these two commands produce zero results:\r\n```\r\nps -ef | grep jupyter | grep -v grep\r\nps -ef | grep ipykernel | grep -v grep\r\n```\r\nWhen you run a notebook, are you performing any long-running operations or anything that might use lower-level libraries and/or background processes?  Perhaps there's a side-effect on the system shutdown from what you're doing in the notebook.  \r\n\r\nYou also might try a shutdown sequence where you start/stop notebook w/o starting a kernel.  If that works, then you could focus more on the kernel interaction area.",
