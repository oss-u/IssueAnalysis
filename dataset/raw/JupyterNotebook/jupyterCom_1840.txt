    "body": "There are two (possibly three) problems with the `--prefix` argument.\n\nFirst, it overrides the default installation directory structure.  The\n`--root` argument doesn't, it keeps the exact same directory structure.\nThis allows you to just pick up the entire root from your build directory\nand put in the the real root later when doing a package installation and\neverything will be like the `--root` argument wasn't used at all.\n\nSecond, the `--prefix` argument doesn't affect the settings directory (as\nfar as I can tell looking at the source).  The `--root` argument controls\nevery directory, they are all placed relative to `--root`.  Again, this\nlets you transparently move everything at once to its final location.\n\nAnother difference, which may or may not be an issue with any nbextensions\nbut often is with other installations, is that the change of root is\ninvisible to whatever is installed.  So if what is installed keeps track of\nwhere it is installed, it won't see the `--root` directory, it will think\nit is still being installed relative to the normal root.  This makes sure\nthat the applications are portable when the root is changed during package\ninstallation later.\n",
