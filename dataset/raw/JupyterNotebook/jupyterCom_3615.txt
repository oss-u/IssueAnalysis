    "body": "I debugged the issue a little bit and found the following solution:\r\n\r\n**Part 1 - Minimal working example**\r\nThe issue seems to originate from shutil.copyfile, which checks if source and destination file are the same (using os.path.samefile).\r\n\r\nIt appears that the combination of windows and google drive file stream yields invalid results. Here is the minimum example (assuming G:\\My Drive\\foo.txt exists, using python 3.6.2):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> f1 = 'G:\\\\My Drive\\\\foo.txt'\r\n>>> f2 = 'G:\\\\My Drive\\\\foo2.txt'\r\n>>> import shutil\r\n>>> shutil.copyfile(f1, f2)\r\n>>> shutil.copyfile(f1, f2)\r\n```\r\n--> The last line throws the SameFileError although it clearly shouldnt!\r\n\r\nWhereas:\r\n```\r\n>>> f1 = 'G:\\\\My Drive\\\\foo.txt'\r\n>>> f3 = 'C:\\\\Scratch\\\\foo2.txt'\r\n>>> import shutil\r\n>>> shutil.copyfile(f1, f3)\r\n>>> shutil.copyfile(f1, f3)\r\n```\r\n--> Throws no error (correct)!\r\n\r\n**Part 2 - Why?**\r\nHow does this happen? \r\n\r\nIt turns out that shutil.copyfile uses os.path.samefile to determine if a file is being copied on itself:\r\n(from https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/genericpath.py)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Are two filenames really pointing to the same file?\r\ndef samefile(f1, f2):\r\n    \"\"\"Test whether two pathnames reference the same actual file\"\"\"\r\n    s1 = os.stat(f1)\r\n    s2 = os.stat(f2)\r\n    return samestat(s1, s2)\r\n\r\n# Are two stat buffers (obtained from stat, fstat or lstat)\r\n# describing the same file?\r\ndef samestat(s1, s2):\r\n    \"\"\"Test whether two stat buffers reference the same file\"\"\"\r\n    return (s1.st_ino == s2.st_ino and\r\n            s1.st_dev == s2.st_dev)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow unfortunately st_ino depends on windows on the file system (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44158182/meaning-of-st-ino-os-stat-output-in-windows-os) and specifically is st_ino==0 for all files on Google Drive File Stream.\r\n\r\n**Part 3 - Where to go and who to blame?**\r\nIt seems that this error is an unlucky combination of a lazy filesystem (why not report some kind of uid as the inode?) and a naive os python library (Checking for file identity this way seems not to generalize well... why not check if st_ino==0?)\r\n\r\n**Part 4 - The dirty fix**\r\n1) Find genericpath.py of your python library:\r\n```\r\n>>> import os\r\n>>> os.path.genericpath.__file__\r\n'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\\\Shared\\\\Anaconda3_64\\\\lib\\\\genericpath.py'\r\n```\r\n2) In this file, replace the samestat function with the following patch:\r\n```\r\n# Are two stat buffers (obtained from stat, fstat or lstat)\r\n# describing the same file?\r\ndef samestat(s1, s2):\r\n    \"\"\"Test whether two stat buffers reference the same file\"\"\"\r\n    return (s1.st_ino != 0 and\r\n\t\t\ts2.st_ino != 0 and\r\n\t\t\ts1.st_ino == s2.st_ino and\r\n            s1.st_dev == s2.st_dev)\r\n```\r\n3) Save the file. Restart python (and/or jupyter).\r\n4) Be happy and wait until either google or the python fixes this issue properly...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
