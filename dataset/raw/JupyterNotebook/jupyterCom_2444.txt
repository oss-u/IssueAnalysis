    "body": "Hmmm… That's why there's supposed to be a rule around mathjax that you don't treat \\s$\\d as a ending delimiter.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this is also present in markdown cells. The simplest solution is to just escape the `$` with `\\$` so that it would be written as `'from \\$100 to \\$1000'`.\r\n\r\nBut this shouldn't be happening regardless. It's likely related to how delimiters are specified… this goes back to at least 4.0 so I don't think it was recently introduced. \r\n\r\nHowever fixing this is probably going to break people's notebooks because it will be enforcing a stricter approach to parsing mathjax which other people may have been relying on.",
