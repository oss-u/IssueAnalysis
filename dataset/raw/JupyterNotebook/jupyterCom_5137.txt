    "body": "Thanks for using jupyter!\n\nThe high road to enabling a custom experience for a team is to package your\nextension:\n\n>\nhttps://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Distributing%20Jupyter%20Extensions%20as%20Python%20Packages.html\n\nAnd put it... Someplace they can install it from. If it can be open source,\npypi/anaconda.org will host your packages for free. You can pay GitHub,\nanaconda or other companies for private repos. However, both pip and conda\njust need a simple web host, so something like gh-pages, s3, your own\nrepository, or even a shared drive will work.\n\nAssuming you your team has one, you'd then just need to your extension (and\npotential custom registry information) to your requirements.txt or\nenvironment.yml.\n\nAnother approach, if your team is just working on one repo, is to check in\nyour extension python and/or js and a jupyter_notebook_config.py, directly\nto your repo, and expect that they launch their personal notebook servers\nfrom the root of that repo. You can use git submodules (which bring their\nown challenges) if you want to use your extension in multiple root repos\nand are still tinkering, but only maintain the code in one place.\n\nGood luck!\n",
