I very often need it when I want to correct a typo/bug in a cell already planned for execution.\r\nI think a solution could be to be able to choose between 2 modes of execution :\r\n- the classic mode (current one) \"**send immediately**\" where a cell is sent to the kernel for execution immediately (when we hit run on that cell). With this mode the queue cannot be edited easily because it would require changing the kernel message protocol as explained by @jasongrout .\r\n- a new mode \"**send when previous done**\" where **a cell we want to run is sent to the kernel only when the execution of the previous one has finished**. This way we can update the code in the cell until it is sent to the kernel. We would need something to warn the user editing the cell when it has been sent to the kernel.\r\nIf execution time of previous cells is long, this new mode allows us to use that time to fix the code in the subsequent cells, even if  we already hit run on them.\r\nI think adding this mode is the easiest solution because it does not require to change the kernel message protocol and it only needs to be able to know when the previous cell execution is done to trigger the sending of the next one to the kernel.",
