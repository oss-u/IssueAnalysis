When you render the cell, it should show up correctly. So it's not exactly intended behaviour, but it's a limitation we know about.\n\nSomeone may be able to write an extended Markdown mode for Codemirror which knew about this syntax. I think we'd be happy to include the code if someone did that, but it's not high on our priority list.\n",

The problem, as the comment in the code says, seems to be that defining `$` as a delimiter for the LaTeX mode causes the `$$` to be interpreted as two consecutive `$` delimiters instead of a single `$$` one.\r\n\r\nI will investigate the possibility of a workaround.",
