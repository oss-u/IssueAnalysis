NotebookNotary.secret_file = \"/path/to/notebook_secret\"\n```\n\nNow, there is a **big** caveat to this that you should know before you do something like this:\n\n> A shared secret file means that your users can produce notebooks that when other users _open_ them, execute code immediately as the second user. This is the primary thing that trust protects users from.\n",
