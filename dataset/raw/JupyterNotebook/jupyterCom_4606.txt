    "body": "Thank you for the additional information - it was helpful. \r\n\r\nThe KernelRestarter message in the Notebook output occurs when the Notebook's kernel management framework detects that the process it launched for the kernel is no longer responding, so it attempts to restart the kernel.  This \"heartbeat\" occurs every 3 seconds.  Perhaps the processing of the image is interfering with that, although this is just a `Popen.poll()` call that must return a value to indicate termination - so that's probably not it.  That said, you might try checking the kernel's python process via the command line to see if perhaps Notebook is falsely indicating the kernel has terminated.\r\n\r\nThe tensorflow message looks interesting.  Does this message get produced when other images are processed?  Perhaps an incompatibility was introduced with your pytorch installation?\r\n\r\nAs for next steps, aside from independently checking the process's existence, you might try enabling debug logging in your Notebook server (CLI option: `--debug`).  It may provide further insights, although I suspect this is more of a resource/configuration thing at this point.\r\n",
