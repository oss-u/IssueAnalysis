It looks like [PR 587 Travis build 997](https://travis-ci.org/jupyter/notebook/jobs/84794595) hung for 5+ hours. I canceled that build but couldn't restart it or this PR's build. Thanks :cat:\n\nThere was also another Travis job related to the same PR 587 that was running for 24+ hours. I canceled that job too.\n",
