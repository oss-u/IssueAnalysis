Of course had I been running it with tmux or screen it wouldn't be an issue but I don't do that 100% of the time\r\n\r\nFinding the process-id and killing it is easy enough, and it wouldn't take much thought to write a bash-script to do this in one line, but it still seems like if there is a cli command for starting a notebook there should be one for stopping it :) \r\n\r\nJust a thought.  Feel free to close this if you aren't interested or don't have time to address it right now.\r\n\r\n",
