Queue the cell multiple times, but actually execute it when the kernel is available (i.e., that's when the text is 'frozen' in the execution call)\n2. Move a cell to the back of the queue each time it is executed\n3. Let the cell \"execute\" and take the text at that point in time. If the cell is modified and re-executed, the new execution text is entered in the queue also, and doesn't replace earlier executions.\n\nI think (3) is the least surprising, but I can also see users thinking that they can edit a cell's contents before it is actually executed and getting those edits in under the wire.\n",
