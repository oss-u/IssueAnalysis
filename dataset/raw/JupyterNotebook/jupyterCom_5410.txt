    "body": "@Zsailer Hi, thank you for the quick reply. That is why i included my repository with the notebook and screenshots. I have copied the code and remade the project in Jupyterlab, where everything is working fine like it should. The only downside is that i don't seem to be able to get interactive plots. \r\n\r\nIt seems like it was caused by something temporary since the notebook is working again now. I cannot recreate the problem anymore so i guess my problem is fixed. \r\n\r\nThank you anyways!\r\nKind regards",
