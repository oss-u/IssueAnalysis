Otherwise, the runtime directory is located in the mounted /home/jovyan volume and you're crossing \"os boundaries\".

I'm wondering if your permission issue is due to the hybrid nature of things, particularly since that portion of the code needs to perform more operating system specific operations on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nOnce you're able to try things again, it would be great if you could provide the permission denied traceback information as well (in the reproduction case), since we've enhanced the information it produces - as well as to confirm you're indeed seeing the same issue as the OP.\r\n\r\nCircling back, @blankws - did moving to the newer versions help you?   I don't suspect you're also running a Linux-based container on Windows, but need to ask.  Thanks.",

The reason I ask about hub, is that if hub was being launched, it might not convey the env to the notebook/lab image.\r\n\r\nIf you use the image I provided, the `-e` is not required (although its using jupyter_core 4.6.0 - but that shouldn't matter).  I suppose another way to check this is to not provide the volume information - but I'm assuming you have configuration and data set information in each user's (Windows) home directory.  Still, omitting that information add try to start a kernel (i.e., create an empty notebook and successfully perform a cell operation) would provide the same kind of information.  If successful, then I would venture this is related to a filesystem anomaly.\r\n\r\nWhat your latest information is saying is that the kernel-xxx.json file is being created with read-execute bits for group and others despite the fact that the creation mode of the file is asking they be off (0) and only read-write (6) be set for the file's owner.  None of these permissions were enforced back in juptyer_client 5.3.1, which is why that downgrade \"works\".\r\n\r\nIf we can't come to a conclusion (or at least develop new clues), I will need to defer this to someone else.

    "body": "Thanks for the update.  ((I'm sorry about the link to my image.  I just updated it to the non-cloud url so perhaps you may have better luck - although it probably isn't necessary.))\r\n\r\nNice find on the docker/windows issue - I suspect this may be another manifestation of that.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what else winds up in `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR` but I would recommend the following.\r\n\r\n1. Build an image where `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR` is baked into the image (as your repo does), **but ensure its in an image-contained directory (like `/tmp/runtime`)**.\r\n2. Use the image just as you have been doing, mounting the user's home (windows-based) directory as `/home/jovyan`.\r\n\r\nI believe the `secure_write` function is currently used only when writing the kernel connection file and don't expect there to be other cases of this.  The connection files will be written properly since we'd now be pointing those writes to a Linux-based filesystem and your current use of the data within the mount volume should still be accessible.  \r\n\r\nOf course, I can't guarantee other \"instances\" of this filesystem issue elsewhere in the Jupyter stack, but I don't believe there are areas this stringent about the permissions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help and patience!",

    "body": "@vnijs - thanks for the question.  \"edge-case\" was a bit optimistic now that I realize that the runtime dir is a function of the jupyter data dir - which defaults to somewhere in the user's home directory.  So yes, users that mount their Windows directory to `/home/jovyan` can expect issues provided either jupyter data dir or jupyter runtime dir have not been adjusted.  \r\n\r\nI still believe this particular \"use-case\" shouldn't warrant exposing sensitive information. After all, the entire reason @MSeal introduced these changes was to address a security issue.  I'm sorry this has affected you and your students, but I think, given the duration this filesystem issue has existed, we're relegated to \"workaround mode\".\r\n\r\nIf the files in your user's Windows directory are used exclusively in their Notebook/Lab environment, then I suspect this could be worked around in a slightly different manner by mounting the Windows user's directory to some other location in the container and adding `--notebook-dir=<that location>` to the docker run command.  This assumes the data in the Windows user's home directory is where the notebook and data files reside, etc.  Personally, I think it's best (and more intuitive) to point only runtime dir to a local directory.  \r\n\r\nI suppose this could be something to bake directly into the jupyter-stack images, but I'd like to get @parente's opinion on this.
