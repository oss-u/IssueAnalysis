    "body": "Thanks, that does reproduce it. After a while, Firefox gives me the option to stop the page's Javascript, and then I get a traceback in the JS console. It looks like it's coming from the markdown parser.\r\n\r\nThen I took the file and started deleting bits to see which bit was causing the problem. It's this paragraph:\r\n\r\n> Just to recap, a variable can be created to hold a value (e.g. x <- 42) however this will only hold one value - or at least a reference to only one. A vector will effectively allow multiple values to be references, similar to a list.  A vector will contain values of the same data type (numeric, character, boolean).\r\n\r\nI think the issue is with that `<` symbol. That could be the start of an HTML tag, and the regex that looks for that is getting stuck 'backtracking' - evaluating different possible ways to match the rest of the input after that. We use a Javascript parser called *marked*, and I think you've hit this bug: https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1058\r\n\r\nFor your side, the easiest fix is to make that R statement a bit of inline code, by putting backticks around it:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n`x <- 42`\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor our side, the bug has already been fixed in marked, so hopefully we just need to ensure that the next release of notebook bundles a newer marked. I'm trying to check that now.",
