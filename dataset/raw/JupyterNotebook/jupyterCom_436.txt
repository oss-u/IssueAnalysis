But it is conceivable to allow it to be _used_ without mathjax. I don't feel too strongly about it, though, so if we want to remove the ability for it to run without mathjax, I'm okay with that proposal (in which case Deprecation is appropriate), though I would recommend bringing that up on the list in case there is anyone relying on it now.\n",
