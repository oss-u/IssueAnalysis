But it is conceivable to allow it to be _used_ without mathjax. I don't feel too strongly about it, though, so if we want to remove the ability for it to run without mathjax, I'm okay with that proposal (in which case Deprecation is appropriate), though I would recommend bringing that up on the list in case there is anyone relying on it now.\n",

If you are missing time or have any other issues that prevent you to work on that, please feel free to tell us, we can try to build on top of what you did. \n\nThanks a lot and looking forward to see this moving forward again.\n",
