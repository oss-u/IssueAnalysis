Do you mind adding a bit more detail about what you're seeing and what you expect to see? Also, I suggest posting your issue on the [Jupyter Discourse page](https://discourse.jupyter.org/) instead, where you'll likely receive more timely help. There are more people watching that channel. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, it appears the autocompletion isn't behaving has you'd expect. Is that correct?",

Its`7.20.0` version tolerates the updated jedi - which was causing some tab-completion issues with older ipython versions.",
