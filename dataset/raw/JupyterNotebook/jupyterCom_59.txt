Because of this, I think it is mixing abstractions and will lead to hackish implementation and user confusion.

Then any kernel could send back output that can be clicked on to open a JupyterLab document. On further thought, we already have this as hyperlinks in output in JupyterLab already open the corresponding document in lab.",
