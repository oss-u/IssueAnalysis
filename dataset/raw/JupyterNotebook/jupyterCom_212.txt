The discussion on that issue more or less concluded that it might be worth having utils keep a list of which extensions have been loaded, to prevent this. This would also open up potential for a user-viewable list of active extensions (say in a menu somewhere), if that seemed useful. It might be worth adding a reload option to force multiple loads of the same extension path, although I can't immediately see a use for it.\n\nI'd be happy to start trying to implement the above, with any modifications, if you think it'd be useful?\n",
