    "body": "You use several things to help diagnose what's happening.\r\n\r\n1) `import sys; sys.executable` will tell you what is your curent python\r\n2) from within a notebook `!{sys.executable} -m pip` will use the pip of currentkernel.\r\n3) Conda-installed' notebook have their own patch with condakernels (not sure about the name) that autodetect environments. It does though break nbconvert --execute\r\n\r\n\r\n> That did nothing to change the situation, except that once I opened a notebook, and tried import notebook, it would tell me that it had no notebook module. From that I surmised that it was correctly executing the command, but somehow when activating the kernel, it's going to the wrong place.\r\n\r\nThat kind-of make sens (or at least it does not not-make-sens) as the server may be on a different machine so the env you see is the kernel's one, not the notebook one. The question is:\r\nShould the notebook only see envs restricted to where it's installed, or all the system envs. Both case make sens, but the one we choose (IIRC) is that a notebook see all kernels. Indeed you might want to install notebook with py3, and kernel with Py2. Plus the notion of \"envs\" is often Python specific. Ence while kernels are regularly machine-wide. \r\n\r\nI don't remember either if ipykernel install the specs at install time or need to be triggered manually. We can resolve that in person later and investigate, but I would expect it to be a corner case of developing the notebook. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
