    "body": "Each time I go to run jupyter I end up with a hung jupyter-notebook.exe process for an extended period of time. On the command line the process will return to the command prompt right away, and I can see via process explorer that jupyter-notebook.exe is in fact running, but it doesn't appear to do anything. \n\nIf I run it again from the same command line I will then get the typical informational messages saying that the server is running - I do not know if this is from the first or second process - but it happens shortly after the second is run.\n\nI suspect this is what is causing the crash when exiting via Control-C, as both processes are stopped when that occurs (and python.exe crashes).\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say it has something to do with running the command appearing to execute disconnected from the cmd.exe process that launched it (i.e., it instantly returns to the command line) - that never used to be how ipython worked, it would remain connected and blocking the cmd.exe process (which in this case is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /k \"C:\\Anaconda3\\Scripts\\anaconda.bat\").\n",
