    "body": "@chmp You should be commended on a brilliant attempt at tackling this.  This is the best option I see so far. \r\n\r\nIn your [README](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest), you identify a few issues that are not obvious to most people and require attention, particularly with clearing the notebook globals when running tests.  In the future, I hope there will be more dialog between the jupyter and pytest teams on making a idiomatic solution.  Preferably, all the required boilerplate would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n\r\n%pytest\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am a bit hesitant to pepper additional magic throughout my notebooks to run tests.  It is the only reason I still use `nose`.  ))",

I understand your comment to have two parts:\r\n\r\n- \"global state handling is sup-optimal\": I feel this issue is deeply tied to the notebook model and I don't see a simple way out. Deleting all old tests worked for me so far.\r\n- \"assertion rewriting via magics is cumbersome\": I fully agree. The newest `ipytest` version (`0.4.0b1`) does not longer require magics to rewrite asserts.\r\n\r\nSince I do not want to highjack the `notebook` issue tracker for `ipytest` issues, I collected my comments [here](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest/issues/5). Feel free to comment and re-open the issue in case the changes do not work for you.",
