    "body": "This issue is coming out of the IPython package when its attempting to use the history sqlite DB.  Given that you likely have two other Notebook servers running (by virtue of the used ports messages at startup) and the issue regards contention with another process:\r\n> PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\Users\\jeffrey\\.ipython\\profile_default\\history.sqlite' -> 'C:\\Users\\jeffrey\\.ipython\\profile_default\\history-corrupt-2020-08-18T11.48.18.725484.sqlite'\r\n\r\nI recommend the following:\r\n1. Stop any Notebook servers that are running.  This can usually be accomplished using `jupyter notebook stop`, but you might need to resort to locating the appropriate python process via task manager and terminating that way.\r\n2. Once all Notebook servers have been shutdown, try the issue again.  Should you still run into issues that appear to be DB related (search for `sqlite` in the console output), stop the Notebook server and see next step.\r\n3. Unless you have affinity to your ipython history, remove the file 'C:\\Users\\jeffrey\\.ipython\\profile_default\\history.sqlite' and try again.\r\n4. Should the issue still persist, you'll need to open an issue in the [IPython repo](https://github.com/ipython/ipython).",
