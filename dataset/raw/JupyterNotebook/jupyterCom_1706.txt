    "body": "Copied from the original discussion at the ipywidgets repo:\n\n> I am going to put some cycles on this this week or next week. Putting the conf.d thing on the side,, here are a few things I think should be changed:\n\nNice and thanks in advance!\n\n> sys-prefix install should be the default instead of system for both enabling and installing. People are confused when enabling/installing an nbextension requires different privileges from the pip install. Doing anything else than --sys-prefix should be a conscious decision. It is also important to note that --user is global to all the python installs that the user may use. (Hence --user is almost always evil).\n\nI totally agree with you here...\n\n> When installing an nbextension, --override should be True by default. Otherwise people don't know that they may have an older version of the js installed.\n\nSound reasonable, in fact, in some conda-packaged nbextensions we are using --override by default.\n\n> Uninstalling an nbextension should also disable the nbextension.\n\nI agree too, people forget about disabling and that could bring some problematic leftovers... people usually request installation and activation to be separated, but I believe in this case, one thing (uninstalltion) should cause the other (disabling) as well..\n\n> A major change that I want to put in place is that if nbextension is loaded because it is enabled in e.g. sys-prefix, the assets should only looked for in sys-prefix. If it is loaded because enabled in the user configuration directory, it should only load the assets in the user data directory etc...\n\nmmm... not sure about this in a composite scenario, I can see a scenario where sys-prefix installed extensions provides some \"common\" extensions (ie, provided by anaconda distro or a conda-forge set of extensions, etc) and user installed/enabled extensions that a user wrote and want to enable in all their notebook instances without installing the extension in every environment (maybe hundreds?).\n\n> At the moment, disabling an extension with --user (i.e. setting it to False in the user nbconfig) will cause the extension to not be enabled even if it is enabled e.g. in sys-prefix because the user configuration has the priority - which is really silly. This problem will go when I fix the previous one.\n\nThat maybe should be warned? In the same scenario I described above, I can see a use case to disable one extension in all my envs without disabling it in every environment...\n",
