    "body": "Hi, this appears to have broken [a template](https://github.com/jcb91/IPython-notebook-extensions/blob/721b2f7f9939182f58146924ebd957a6e4fa2a19/src/themysto/nbextensions_configurator/templates/nbextensions_configurator.html) based on `page.html`, which now throws an error from requirejs with a stack beginning `TypeError: $ is not a function`. It seems that in this template, `window.$` is undefined. I'm not really sure how/where `window.$` is supposed to get defined, and it seems a bit strange to set a jquery path in [notebook/templates/page.html#L33](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/ee44d1947f0ad9e3ca309ac6d9d1aa1778e9d0ee/notebook/templates/page.html#L33), only to re-define it further down the page in [notebook/templates/page.html#L88](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/ee44d1947f0ad9e3ca309ac6d9d1aa1778e9d0ee/notebook/templates/page.html#L88).\n\nSo, yeah, any info on what the thinking behind this is, and what am I doing wrong appreciated :)\n",
