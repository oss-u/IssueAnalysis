Maybe it is the case in the two examples you give under \"Writing into the notebook server info file\" ?\r\n\r\nMore generally, my concern is about using `jupyter-notebook` as a proxied service (in a docker container, behind a proxy etc.), and needing both a publicly accessible URL for the users, and an internal URL for administering. But maybe it's actually a non-issue? \r\n\r\n@minrk, regarding the URL vs host terminology:\r\n\r\nAgreed! I initially kept the name proposed in #3605 for consistency, but I think it would be better to rename it. Just waiting for the discussion to converge on what to do to rename it accordingly.",

    "body": "I guess the question is:\r\n\r\n1. should the user be able to specify what URL should be used to connect to the notebook server in general (connection_url), or\r\n2. *only* specify what URL should be printed in the logs (display_url), i.e. what a human should use to open the notebook, but not affect anything that discovers the URL programmatically.\r\n\r\n1 would allow things like `jupyter notebook list` to provide useful info for connecting from outside the container, but possibly break things like `jupyter notebook stop` *inside* the container. 2 suggests that we never want the notebook to know its own URL that things should use, e.g. reporting its own connection URL for use outside the container after the initial log.\r\n\r\nFrom your use cases, I think `jupyter notebook list` in the container would work *better* in the first case, because it would give you the info you need to connect from outside the container, rather than having to dig into the logs for that. That said, I don't think that the process-management tools like `notebook list` and `notebook stop` make a great deal of sense in a container, since there's necessarily only one server and it can be terminated normally with `docker stop` commands, etc.\r\n\r\nI genuinely don't know the right answer for this. Overriding display_url is certainly the least disruptive since it can't break anything, but overriding connect_url enables solving the same \"How should things connect to me\" problem in multiple places, not just the logs. I'm genuinely not sure what the right answer is.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to add a separate 'remote_url' for connections from 'remote' hosts (e.g. the host system in the docker case), and store and display this alongside connection_url, essentially baking in the fact that there can never be only one answer to the URL question when running in containers.",
