I pulled this PR branch and re-installed using pip install -e . --user...\n\n`jupyter bundlerextension` should just work. Are you saying it doesn't? I dev'ed locally by pip installing into a conda environment. Is `--user` breaking it?\n\n> Once the bundlerextension extension is working, can I test the zip bundler using jupyter bundlerextension enable --py notebook.bundler.zip_bundler --sys-prefix?\n\nThis is definitely a good place to start. There's a tarball bundler in there too that you can try also.\n\n> Anything else I should test?\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards_bundlers/pull/46 makes the dashboards bundlers extension compatible with this new API. If you're feeling brave, you might try testing that.It'll take a bit of doing, namely getting the dashboard extension installed, the bundler extension built with the PR installed, and the dashboard server running to see if the bundler properly packs and sends one of the example notebook-dashboards to the dashboard server properly. If that's too much overhead (and it probably is), don't sweat it. I did test it once already when creating that PR. If this merges in, I'll test it against notebook HEAD.\n",
