Both `jupyter_client` and `nbformat` are python-specific packages, so I find this odd relative to those references.\r\n\r\nWhile poking around, I stumbled upon this thread: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/mailman/maxima-discuss/thread/976d2795-a1e2-d0ed-d46b-28aeae37f632%40acanac.net/#msg37136685\r\n\r\nAs the responder points out, we will need more context.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might try launching `jupyter notebook` with `--debug` to enable DEBUG tracing.  If there are ways to enable tracing for the maxima kernel, that might be helpful as well.  \r\n\r\nI'm curious what your `kernel.json` file looks like for this kernel.  Could you please provide that also?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
