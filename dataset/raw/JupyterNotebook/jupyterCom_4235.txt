    "body": "> shut down inactive kernels after X seconds, and then shut down the server Y seconds after that\r\n\r\nI think that's a reasonable interpretation, it just doesn't happen to be mine. I initially thought this was fine, but as an operator of mybinder.org, it's been a little frustrating. There, I want to set a single timer for user goes away -> server shuts down. Whether they left kernels lying around doesn't influence when I want their server to be shutdown. I can't have that if we register idle-timeouts of kernels as activity. So my choice is either to set a more aggressive kernel timeout so the *effective* timeout of idle_shutdown + kernel timeout is ten minutes. But this would result in a different and shorter effective timeout for non-kernel-based sessions such as those just using terminals or rstudio behind nbrsessionproxy.",
