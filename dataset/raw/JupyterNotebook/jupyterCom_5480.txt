I've done some investigation already, and I think I see where to start.\r\n\r\nThe docs at that page are generated by a call to `notebook.NotebookApp.document_config_options()` in `docs/autogen_config.py`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/a5ace13e0a5d99f314e3b933b2b079ff0bffbd5a/docs/autogen_config.py#L45.\r\n\r\n`notebook.NotebookApp` gets that method from the parent class `jupyter_core.JupyterApp`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/2cfff07a39fa486a3f05c26b400fa26e1802a053/notebook/notebookapp.py#L677\r\n\r\nWhich gets that method from its parent, `traitlets.config.Application`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/blob/e69a436529838dce8b41e6d4508f94930c87b559/jupyter_core/application.py#L47\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ipython/traitlets/blob/2bb2597224ca5ae485761781b11c06141770f110/traitlets/config/application.py#L543\r\n\r\nSo I think that the right place to fix this is over in in `traitlets` (https://github.com/ipython/traitlets).\r\n",
