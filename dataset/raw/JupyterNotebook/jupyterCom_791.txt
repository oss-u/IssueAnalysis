Less than optimal but you can do it. \n\nWe encourage people to develop extension to play with what a better UI could be, and to formalize the metadata structure. \n\nTypically you use author singular, should it be plural ? Is it a string ? An object with first/last/given name ? A github handle ? Is there a field for primary author ?\n\nThese are question we don't have a lot of bandwidth to tackle and we encourage the community to form subgroup, discuss comme up with a proposal, implementation plan. But it is far from a \"just throw 3 textfield on the page\" kind of things. \n",
