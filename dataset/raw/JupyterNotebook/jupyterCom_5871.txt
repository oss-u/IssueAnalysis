    "body": "Hi @loretoparisi - this description is consistent with the notebook kernel not running in the expected environment.  \r\n\r\nI see you're running the notebook in the background.  Is this being run as a 'service'?  If so, it's probably not reflecting the logic in your `.profile` since its not a login shell and you may need to apply similar logic to that script.\r\n\r\nIf that's not what is going on and you're launching notebook from your login shell, you might run down this list of items...\r\n1. Check the values of `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` immediately prior to `jupyter notebook` to ensure they reflect the correct CUDA information.\r\n2. Once the kernel/notebook is started, please do the same from the cells using `!echo $PATH` and `!echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` - I'm assuming there will be no change in behavior and these will not reflect the appropriate values.\r\n3. You should find that `!env` produces the same results as prior to the launch of the server, with the exception LD_LIBRARY_PATH - which you are replacing with the value in the kernel.json file.  I would recommend against this since the env should _flow_ from the notebook process to the kernel process anyway.  (Although it was a valid troubleshooting step to take!) \r\n4. Add `--debug` to your `jupyter notebook` command and see if there are any clues logged when the kernel is started.  You should see the same argv array logged in a debug message, so please confirm that's the case.\r\n\r\n((I'm sure this is a copy/paste issue, but you have a trailing `fi` on your export of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.))\r\n",
