    "body": "@Gilthans I think you are using an old version of jupyter notebook. Since jupyter notebook version >= 6.1.0, notebook UI layout is *not* affected by browser language. For more information check out https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/5052#issuecomment-647725947.\r\n\r\nNote that the tree view (i.e. the first screenshot in your post) is still affected by browser language, but the notebook itself (i.e. the second screenshot) doesn't care about browser language.\r\n\r\nP.S. I've just done the repro steps on my notebook installation (version 6.1.5), and here's what I got:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26688819/103305798-5677cc80-4a21-11eb-971f-d9de28f56635.png)\r\n\r\nP.S. 2\r\n> If anything, I'd want the word שלום to be right-aligned, but nothing else.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve this in version >= 6.1.0. In your LTR notebook, select the cell you want to right-align. Then open the command palette and select `toogle current cell ltr/rtl direction`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26688819/103306931-09492a00-4a24-11eb-978b-d4225d8cb8aa.png)",
