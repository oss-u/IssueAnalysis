I'm not sure what JupyterLab is exactly, but I imagine most of it would be optional for SageMath's purposes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the npm ecosystem is full of practises that make things hard for package managers. If you could avoid packages that do these sorts of practises, that would be helpful for me and others. If not, then we'll perpetually have to find workarounds. For example, packages:\r\n\r\n- that split themselves into 30+ packages with 30 public version histories that maintainers need to track\r\n- that use overly-complex buildsystems that really just boil down to a 5-line shell script\r\n- whose build process involves downloading binary blobs off the internet\r\n- that include binary blobs (e.g. prebuilt javascript) in their source repositories\r\n- that depend on specifically-built versions of other packages not in the main npm repo\r\n- that don't follow semantic versioning\r\n- that do follow semantic versioning but change their major version every week so it's basically pointless\r\n- that do follow semantic versioning but perpetually stay on version 0.x yet are depended-upon by many other packages. (Many of these could be very deep down in your dependency tree.)\r\n\r\nThis isn't good for users either, at least ones that care about using verifiably-open source code. We have to follow these standards when packaging things for Debian, unlike the npm ecosystem which enforces none of these standards. Yes, not having standards makes certain aspects of development very easy for developers, but you should consider other participants of the software ecosystem as well, when writing software.\r\n",

    "body": "The \"bundling\" approach is only suitable for large teams with enough developer resources to follow all of the transitive dependencies' development to pull in critical bugfixes. The vast majority of developer teams don't have the time nor resources to do this, so the final result is that nobody knows what code is actually being run, how out-of-date this is, and what sort of bugs it contains. This is very easy-to-use from a developer point-of-view, but is a complete abdication of one's responsibility to one's users. Debian and other distros unbundling dependencies, and ensuring that there is only one copy of any particular piece of software available in the whole distribution, helps to avoid this mess and is a very efficient way of using volunteer resources to provide these QA guarantees.\r\n\r\nEvery new version of a given package that is kept coinstallable with other versions (e.g. because they are bundled as dependencies of two different larger pieces of software), is effectively keeping a fork of that package, along with all the maintenance costs it brings. Ignoring these costs and pretending they don't exist, just piles up the technical debt and means users end up running unmaintained software.\r\n",
