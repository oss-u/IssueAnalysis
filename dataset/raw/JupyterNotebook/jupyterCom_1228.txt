Starting to do more complex layout in the existing notebook is sort of opening a can of worms. I really prefer to avoid that and instead start to do work involving more complex layout in JupyterLab instead.\n\nOne result of the dev meeting we had last week though is that we are going to come up with a good migration plan for existing nbextensions to transition to JupyterLab. More details soon...\n",

    "body": "@ellisonbg That's OK. So JupyterLab is the Jupyter version of original nbextensions? \nI think it would be great if we can make the extension system works just like `rubygem`, where you can install things simply by specifying it in a file and run a install command. Now the `nbextension` is just very hard to install, you need to download the file by hand, put them in the right place etc, and hard to update. \n",
