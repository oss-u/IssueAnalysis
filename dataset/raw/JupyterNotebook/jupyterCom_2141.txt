My understanding has been that this makes more sense to do as part of the standalone `jupyter-server`, rather than rewrite the extensions for 5.0 and then rewrite them again for `jupyter-server`. But if we want this for 5.0, we should get on it ASAP, because I think it would delay 5.0 by at least a month or two so it can have time to test in master. We could also decide to do *part* of it (e.g. change defaults, but not behavior), which is easier, but I'm not sure if we should do that.",
