    "body": "Those don't seem like stupid questions!\r\n\r\n1. As you guessed, the real answer is 'I don't know, we just got this from tornado'. But I would guess that it ensures that the pattern matches the whole of the hostname, not just a prefix. `$` means the end of the string. In the case of `.*`, I think it doesn't make any difference, because Python's regex engine is greedy by default, but perhaps it's a good habit to get into, and explicit is better than implicit.\r\n\r\n2. I would guess the host name and the path have to be kept separate, though I haven't checked how tornado actually handles them. From the perspective of HTTP, these are two separate fields a request can have, though we represent them in URLs as a single string.",
