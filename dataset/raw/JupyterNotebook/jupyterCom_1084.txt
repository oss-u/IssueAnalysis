But fine if merge as is I can remove later.\n\n> Added fast_finish option to cause Travis to end on success or initial failure.\n\n-1 , we have random failures that will force us to rerun all instead of just the failing one(s) . And we have many groups, which test differents part, which mean that you cannot in one glance see all the failing test. \nI hate matplotlib that does that, and don't even test your code if it's not pep8 compliant.\n\n+1 on the rest\n",
