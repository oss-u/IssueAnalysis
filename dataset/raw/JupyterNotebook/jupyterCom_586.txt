That's something we're in the process of documenting :book: across all the subprojects. \n\nUsage questions and questions that span multiple projects are probably best asked at jupyter@googlegroups.com. If you are not yet subscribed to that Google Group, you may find that helpful.\n\nIf the question is isolated to errors in a specific project (for example, jupyter-js-services) where it's possible that it may be an issue or something that needs better documentation, I suggest opening an issue in the particular project's repo (in this case, jupyter-js-services).\n\nI hope that helps :smile:\n",
