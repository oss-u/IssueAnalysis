    "body": "When you save a notebook you have run on one computer, it saves a signature in the database to record that the contents of the current notebook are trusted. If you then change it on another computer, it has a different signature, which is not in the database, and so it shows up as untrusted. With this scheme, sharing the secret key is not enough to share 'trust' between the two computers.\r\n\r\nWhen we first added a trust mechanism, we stored the signature in the notebook file itself; with this, sharing the static secret key file was enough to share trust. But it was annoying for version control, and in the default case (without doing anything to share trust), merely opening a notebook and saving it again with no changes rewrites the signature, so it's even easier to make the notebook 'untrusted' on a system which should trust it. For this reason, we changed to the sqlite signature store.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to plug in your own signature store, if you're willing to run a database server that all of your computers can access. Unfortunately, that's the only really robust way we've so far come up with to share trust between computers, and it's obviously not practical for many users.",
