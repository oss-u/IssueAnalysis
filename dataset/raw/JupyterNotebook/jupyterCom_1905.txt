    "body": "Thanks @gnestor, that sounds good to me. I don't think there's a pressing need for 'edit raw'.\n\nI'd still probably agree with Min that I'd only show the buttons with a single file selected, and avoid popup blockers altogether. I think the main thing we wanted to fix is that there's no easy way to view an HTML file, because clicking on it opens an editor. I don't feel strongly about this, though.\n\nWe should think about the **security implementations**. An HTML file could contain Javascript, which can execute when you 'view' it. Because it's served from the notebook domain, that Javascript can presumably start a kernel and use it to execute code (unless I've overlooked something). That seems a bit unexpected for a 'view' action. Is there any way we can mitigate this? Ping @rgbkrk \n",
