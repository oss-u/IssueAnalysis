    "body": "That looks like a very elegant way to \"fake\" inverse support with CSS!\r\n\r\nHowever, one problem I'm seeing in my output is that it appears to be assuming that the background color (which becomes the foreground of the inverse) is white when it may not be.  Example:\r\n\r\n![here](https://i.imgur.com/oqUDMtE.png)\r\n\r\nI suspect there's no reliable way to deal with that given the need to precompute styles ahead of time and not knowing what the background will be...  But if there must be a default, I would think black foreground would be the most sensible, since the ANSI stuff tends to be used for terminal output, and terminals have traditionally used black as the default background.",
