In that case, it looks like the server is still there.\r\n\r\nIt's preferable to always ask the server to shut down cleanly, e.g. by calling `notebook.notebookapp.shutdown_server` with the info of the server you want to stop. That lets it clean up the server info file it created. If you kill it, it can't do that.",
