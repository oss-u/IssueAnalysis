    "body": "@minrk or @Carreau, any thoughts on this? \r\n\r\n@quantophred and I spent a decent amount of time debugging this in the Quantopian notebook frontend before realizing it was actually a bug in upstream. We've currently got a workaround in place internally to handle issues that were specific to Q customizations, but we don't have a good way to fix this bug in the case where the user opens a new notebook via `new_untitled`, immediately closes it, and then opens it again. This isn't a super common behavior pattern for users, so it's not a burning fire by any means, but it would be nice to fix this if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
