    "body": "Hi @vevek-git,\r\n\r\nA few observations:\r\n- notebook (to the best of my knowledge) only recognizes notebook files (ipynb) as non-parameter arguments.\r\n- You'll probably want to quote your paths since they have spaces and argument parsers can't make that determination.\r\n- I would imagine the notebook file argument doesn't need to be fully qualified but, instead, qualified relative to the `notebook-dir` value (to simplify the command line).\r\n- If you just want to run the notebook to completion as a service, I would strongly recommend looking at https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient and/or https://github.com/nteract/papermill.  These applications are dedicated to running notebooks directly.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the Windows scheduler so can't really comment on that portion.  However, there might be examples on some of the referenced repos for how those applications can be integrated with things like that.",
