    "body": "I tried creating a conda environment with notebook version 5.6, but that didn't fix the behavior. I think that has something to do with needing to install another jupyter kernel within the environment. To simplify things, I uninstalled Anaconda and reinstalled version Anaconda3 5.3.1 for Windows x64. This fixed the behavior:\r\n\r\n![jupyter_autocomplete2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3360192/50532240-97604200-0ae4-11e9-8f72-3beaa4801166.gif)\r\n\r\nThe installed notebook version is 5.6.0. Python version 3.7.0\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to narrow down the origin. I can provide additional information as needed. I'll keep poking around trying to figure out the cause. ",

    "body": "I set-up an env in Anaconda using the latest Jupyter tools and have been poking around at this issue. At first, I tried a following stack traces to determine what might be the cause (no luck). Then, I decided confirm that this was a Notebook issue. I found the following reversions did **not** fix the problem:\r\n\r\n- `Notebook 5.7.4 → 5.6.0`\r\n-  `jedi 0.13.2 → 0.12.1` \r\n- `jupyter_client 5.2.4 → 5.2.3`\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm closing this issue.\r\n\r\nI could only narrow the problem down to one of the following packages:\r\n\r\n- ~~`ipykernel >4.10.0`~~\r\n    - `5.1.0` did not revert the behavior\r\n- ~~`ipython>6.5.0`~~\r\n    - `7.0.1` and `7.1.1` did not revert the behavior. \r\n    - `7.2.0` **did** cause the problem to re-emerge.\r\n- ~~`jupyter_console >5.2.0`~~\r\n    - `6.0.0` did not revert the behavior\r\n- ~~`prompt_toolkit >1.0.15`~~\r\n    - `2.0.7` did not revert the behavior\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that it has something to do with the `ipython` issues reported here \r\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11530\r\n\r\n**Edit:** after selectively updating packages, I narrowed the issue down to `ipython 7.2.0`. The problem was solved after placing the following code in `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`\r\n\r\n```\r\nc = get_config()\r\nc.IPCompleter.use_jedi = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix was noted in other issues, including the link above, as well as https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11546 by ",
