    "body": "Hi Kevin, \r\n\r\nI have found that it is nothing to do with the jupyter_http_over_ws install. Moreover, I have found that it is due to a 'token' issue. \r\n\r\nI currently have a password setup but despite this I am still receiving 403 'Forbidden' messages. I am unsure of how to get around this. Following the exact procedure below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_http_over_ws\r\n\r\njupyter notebook \\\r\n  --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com' \\\r\n  --port=8888 \\\r\n  --NotebookApp.port_retries=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpens the notebook in safari, however I am trying to run Google Colab in chrome, and when I pass the ' http://localhost:8888/' url generated by the shell I am hit with a 403 error. After having to completely reinstall Anaconda and restart the process, the shell provided me with a token with which I could pass to Colab and successfully connect to the local host, however since adding a password I am now back to square one.\r\n\r\nIf you have any workaround here I would be really grateful, as I this is a real hindrance. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

You imply that once you updated jupyter_http_over_ws to 0.0.7 you began having these issues.  Did other aspects of your installation remain the same or did the version of Notebook also get updated?  What version of Notebook are you using?\r\n\r\n2. Your latest comment indicates that 0.0.7 works with Safari, but not Chrome.  Have you tried using an incognito window so that existing cookies, etc. are not \"in play\"?\r\n\r\n3. Have you tried reverting the extension to the previous version you were using to see if that makes a difference?",

At time of writing, my jupyter notebook version is 6.0.1. I noticed that upon first launch, I was provided with a token that I could pass to Colab in order to connect to the runtime (which worked) but I then of course had to set a password. \r\n\r\nNow, when i launch the same procedure the token is no longer provided, and hence Colab is prevented from connecting.\r\n\r\n- Your latest comment indicates that 0.0.7 works with Safari, but not Chrome. Have you tried using an incognito window so that existing cookies, etc. are not \"in play\"? -  I have tried clearing cookies and the cache, as well as trying to connect through an incognito window but to no avail :(\r\n\r\n- Have you tried reverting the extension to the previous version you were using to see if that makes a difference? I have not yet - I will take a look\r\n",
