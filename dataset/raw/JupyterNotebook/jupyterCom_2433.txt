    "body": "I propose that we use labels only for a few particularly important buttons (making a bigger target that's easier to click), and for things that aren't otherwise clear. E.g. For cite2c, I want to have a 'Cite' label to highlight what the button group is, because there's no widely recognised icon for citations.\r\n\r\nDesign choices:\r\n- Not to use the help text from the action: it's typically longer, e.g. \"run cell, select below\"\r\n- Not to store the label as a new attribute on the action. Conceptually, this is related to the toolbar button, not the underlying action. Also, doing it this way makes it easy to add labels to old-style button definitions that don't use an action.",
