    "body": "Sorry about this disruption. Allow me to explain a bit why we've made this change.\r\n\r\nIssue #1830 pointed out that an attacker running a malicious DNS server can get round the same-origin requirements which browsers normally impose. It seems likely that this would apply to Jupyter running in its default configuration on localhost. If so, the practical upshot of this would be that a malicious website could use your browser to communicate with Jupyter and run code on your system.\r\n\r\nThis reminded us of a less severe problem that we've been aware of for a while: on a system with multiple users logged in, any user can access any other user's notebook server which is not protected by a password.\r\n\r\nNeither of these should be a problem if you're running in Jupyterhub, or if you have configured the notebook with a password. But many people (myself included) use the notebook in its default configuration: listening on localhost with no password, trusting that either we're the only one logged in to the machine, or we can trust anyone else who may log in.\r\n\r\nSo the token mechanism is intended to restrict access to the server while inconveniencing the standard user as little as possible. When you start the server, it generates two tokens: one reusable, one one-time. The reusable one is shown in the terminal (or log) to use when connecting another browser. The one-time token is used to open the notebook in the primary browser - opening a URL involves passing it as a command line argument, which on some platforms is visible to other users, so we don't pass the reusable token. When the browser provides either token in the URL, the server gives it a cookie to authenticate future requests.\r\n\r\nAttackers using the DNS trick, and other users sharing the system with you, should not know either an auth cookie nor a usable auth token, so the server will deny their requests.\r\n\r\nWe know a change like this is going to cause some pain, but we think it's necessary to fix a rather nasty security problem. We'll do our best to help you figure out how to make it work with your use cases.\r\n\r\n@viaregio The token is randomly generated each time you start the server, so there isn't really a fixed default. Unfortunately the autogenerated config docs don't know about that.",
