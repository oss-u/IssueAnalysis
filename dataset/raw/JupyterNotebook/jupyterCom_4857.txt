According to the manual, you can do that using:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom notebook.auth import passwd\r\npasswd()\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever I am not able to get the same console output as defined in the manual, I get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'argon2:$argon2id$v=19$m=10240,t=10,p=8$fNc2kqRfyPjplwDKtG1Zmg$gSkTi4DyeuLvveJzzAQKCg'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is very different from what is said in the manual:\r\n\r\n```s\r\nIn [1]: from notebook.auth import passwd\r\nIn [2]: passwd()\r\nEnter password:\r\nVerify password:\r\nOut[2]: 'sha1:67c9e60bb8b6:9ffede0825894254b2e042ea597d771089e11aed'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich seems to be answered here:\r\n\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64299457/jupyter-password-not-hashed\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the docs mentioned this ..",
