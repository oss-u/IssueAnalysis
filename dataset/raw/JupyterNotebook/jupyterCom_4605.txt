    "body": "Hi @shantanuo - your [pandas_examples repo](https://github.com/shantanuo/pandas_examples) doesn't appear to exist - so it's difficult to see the issue.\r\n\r\nAre you committing the notebook file to git yourself, or relying on some extension to perform that operation for you?\r\n\r\nBased on your comment, I assume you had \"scrubbed\" the cells of your access key with \"XXX\", yet the commit is showing the old and new values (access key and its replacement, respectively).  After scrubbing the entries, did you physically save the ipynb or rely on checkpointing to save the file?\r\n\r\nI suspect you might have [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.  Do you see this `nbdiff` button on your toolbar?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22599560/79005340-7e2daa00-7b0b-11ea-89af-fd1f1986a4e3.png)\r\nIf so, you might check it's documentation for how to disable certain operations or try uninstalling it altogether.\r\n\r\nI'll admit, I'm not very familiar with this aspect of the project, but perhaps your responses will provide others with the information they need to help.",
