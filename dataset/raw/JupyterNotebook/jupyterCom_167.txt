    "body": "Sorry for being imprecise in response. `(` and `tab` where deprecated. \n\n@startakovsky sorry this response is long, nothing against you, just historical explanation that I'm tired in repeting in many places, so here it will be.\n\nThe behavior of tab was inconsistent and difficult to understand in many case. \n- `(` after 3sec  not doing anything would trigger tooltip. \n  - which was inconsistent for haskell and other language.\n  - confusing user wondering what they were doing. \n  - wondering why it wouldn't work sometimes (kernel busy)\n- tooltip on tab after `(` in some unambiguous cases.\n  - Sometime leading to completion.\n  - nothing sometimes if kernel busy, even worse would indent. \n  - make user that actually complete on user_ns be pissed of\n- complete on `([space]<tab>`.\n  - sometimes\n  - kernel busy problem again.\n- Add kwarg, comma, space into the mix. \n  - Coma -> tooltip,\n  - Comma space -> complete.\n  - what if arg or kwarg subexpr?\n  - what if several open parens ?\n- Add regex into the mix. \n- Add other kernels into the mix. (so want to config regex,)\n- People that want to completer/tooltip on \n  - space \n  - dollars\n  - dot\n  - backspace\n  - not 3000 ms, but 2250, and only i when not looking at code and actually want tooltip cause it hides code. \n- Should you dismiss the same if auto-popped on `(` than if user press tab/shift tab explicitly ?\n\n(shake the thing and optimize) \n\nShift tab was since long before 1.0 bound to the Always do tooltip, and was alway the way to do it. Despite people saying otherwise on the internet (even our own tuto). It was the obvious non-ambiguous choice that simplified the code and the question about what tab does (@fperez said \"we've weaponized the tab key\"). The problem on that is there is no simple answer to `how do I complete`, `how do i get tooltip` and `what does tab do`.\nHence Tab was : \n- made optional default true\n- made optional default false\n- removed.\n\nThe last 2 might have been in same release cycle. Not sure anymore for `(<wait>`\n\n> Will is going to be working on this stuff during the summer and I think we\n> do want to address some of these UI/UX issues. I would prefer to have a\n> single UI that does everything well, rather than two partial UIs as we have\n> now.\n\nI did propose a tooltippleter, and proposed that the message spec be changed for completion/inspection request to be merged in ; plus a UI type:\n\n```\n  completion 1 | This is the help for the current selection (arrow)\n  completion 2 | on the left of this text, it is the great \n> completion 3 | unified tooltipleter. It is particularly \n  completion 4 | useful for julia as methods have same name\n  completion 5 | multiple dispatch and not same docstring\n  completion 6 | \n```\n\nFor which I was welcome with roughly what **I** (emphased I, don't render great on gh) remember as : We don't see the point, it is useless, the completer completes and tooltips tooltips. These are not the same actions it is perfectly natural to have 2 shortcuts.\n\nSo, sorry if it was better before, sorry if we don't communicate enough, sorry if people don't read [release notes](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/whatsnew/version2.0.html#other-changes), sorry if I can seem annoyed, but I answered this question around 5 times in the last 2 weeks in 4 differents way of communication with people asking the same question on 3 different channel without acknowledging responses, or ignoring responses and reasking somewhere else.\n\nThis is (as we discussed in meeting) reason why gitter and RT chat should be banned from first help channel in which we asked to go (not you @startakovsky) so that they could get information like that in a way that can be googled, and editted. (which is 1 point for not ML first) \n\nPlease feel free to link to this explanation, edit, add links, tags or anything that make it easier to find. \n\nThanks for reading. \n",
