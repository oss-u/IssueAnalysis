    "body": "@mpacer is working towards releasing 5.6, so let's save this for after that's done.\r\n\r\nIf people want to help progress towards 6.0, I'd like to get more eyes on the API and applications of the new modules jupyter_kernel_mgmt and jupyter_protocol. I've recently had a go at updating jupyter_kernel_test to use these, for instance: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_kernel_test/pull/41\r\n\r\nOne specific design question: for request/reply messages, should an 'error' reply be automatically translated into an exception, or returned to let the application code deal with the different reply statuses? The API currently raises an `ErrorInKernel` exception, but in a couple of places now I've caught the exception to turn it back into a return value, so I wonder if that should be how it works.",
