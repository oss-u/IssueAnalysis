    "body": "A bit of explanation: jupyter notebook list prints out one line for each\njupyter notebook server that is running. If you have more than one line, it\nmeans you have more than one server running. Each server is accessible on a\nseparate port, and like you saw, each server has a different token. To find\nthe right server (and hence the right token), match up the port number.\n\nI agree it would be useful to have better explanation, like you suggest.\nWould you like to open an issue in the notebook repo with some suggested\ntext? https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/new will bring up the new\nissue form.\n\nThanks,\n\nJason\n\nOn Fri, Sep 21, 2018 at 7:30 AM jurijpar <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Folks,\n> I am having a struggle as a beginner to learn how to code in Python.

It's hard to know what points are confusing for a new user without having some feedback, exactly like this!\r\n\r\nHere's another thought for how to proceed: `jupyter notebook list` gives full urls which contain the corresponding token. All a user needs to do is find the url with the same port number as they are wanting, copy that entire URL and paste it into the browser url bar. Would that be simpler than trying to describe how to extract the token from the URL?\r\n\r\nTo clarify a few points, for your understanding:\r\n\r\n1. Many people don't use Anaconda, and many don't use Windows (\"Anaconda Prompt\" I think only is something on Windows), so we'd need the general instructions to be more generic than saying to use the Anaconda prompt.\r\n2. `jupyter notebook list` is not generating a token, it's displaying what the current notebook servers there are and what tokens have already been generated for them.\r\n",
