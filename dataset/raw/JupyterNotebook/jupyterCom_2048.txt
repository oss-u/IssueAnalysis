    "body": "Great to see movement on this! I was just talking to @jdfreder about resurrecting the cell tagging efforts.\r\n\r\nUI features that aren't strictly related to the display that would be helpful:\r\n* tab completion & suggestion\r\n    * this could probably reuse the UI paradigm that we use to autocomplete with multiple options in other cases\r\n    * these suggestions could be based on a number of things:\r\n         * all tags previously used in the notebook\r\n         * core supported tags (e.g., those like `jupyter:hide_cell` in nbconvert) \r\n         * tags used by extensions (or at least a list that extensions can write to for getting suggestions) \r\n         * some tags may be more or less appropriate for different kinds of cells (e.g., `jupyter:hide_output` doesn't mean anything for a markdown cell)\r\n    * for the case of prefixed tags, it may be useful to suggest completions that would apply the prefix if the unprefixed text is present (e.g., `hide_cell` → `jupyter:hide_cell`)\r\n* \"clickable\" suggestions (discussed more in https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1812)\r\n\r\nOne downside to this approach to applying tags is that it doesn't have any way to apply to multiple cells at the same time, since multiple cells can be selected, it'd be good to also surface a way to do that. I think that solving that might also suggest a more general UI that would work nicely (especially for applying tags via keyboard shortcut). To be fair, this is a tough problem that none of the other tagging solutions have solved, but it's still worth thinking about.",
