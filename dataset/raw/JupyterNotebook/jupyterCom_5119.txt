    "body": "Hi @Julian,\r\nThanks for the pointer. I've managed to solve this for myself.  When I looked at the path for importlib_metadata, the folder contained no files and only a tests subfolder. \r\n\r\nBy force reinstalling the package \r\n`conda install importlib_metadata --force-reinstall`\r\n\r\nI was able to repair the installation of importlib_metadata and get jsonschema 3.2.0 and Notebook 6.0.3 working. Is there any more information that you would like including on the  issue for future reference?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nDave",
