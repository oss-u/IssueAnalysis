    "body": "Nice, I'm impressed how little code it is to make this possible. :-)\r\n\r\nA few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I'm pretty sure Windows doesn't have these signals; maybe we should disable/hide the options in that case.\r\n- I'd probably put them lower down the menu, maybe in their own little section after 'Shutdown'. I think you'll want them less often than the restart options, for instance. Putting them in their own section also highlights that they go together.\r\n- When the kernel is paused, I'd like to have a persistent notification to that effect, which is clickable to unpause it. Someone's going to accidentally pause the kernel, and it needs to be clear what's happened and how to get out of it. We already have some way of making clickable notifications, so this shouldn't be hard.\r\n- Testing this will be a pain, I suspect.",

    "body": "Oh, and one more:\r\n\r\nWhen we suspend processes in a terminal by pressing Ctrl-Z, that's actually sending SIGTSTP, which has a similar default effect, but can be handled or ignored by the process. I wonder if we should be using that instead of SIGSTOP. It makes the implementation more complex, because you have to somehow check whether pausing the kernel has had any effect, but it may be useful for kernels that know they shouldn't be paused in a certain operation.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's a new feature, maybe we can keep SIGSTOP (the un-ignorable one) for now, and see if any problems come up, but it's worth thinking about.\r\n\r\n[This article](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) is an excellent read on things like this.",

    "body": "@takluyver Thanks for reviewing and sharing your thoughts. I was thinking to just show either \"Pause\" or \"Resume\" button depending on the state of the notebook like a toggle. How do you feel about that ? On persistent notification, I will read more about the clickable notifications in notebook and try to use them here. For testing, I was thinking to run like a print loop and check affects of pause and resume (using selenium).\r\nRegarding choosing between SIGSTOP and SIGTSTP, I used SIGSTOP -- because for end users, when they press \"pause\" they expect their job to pause. Using SIGTSTP  does not guarantee that, and can leave users puzzled for why the pausing did not take place (unless we give them some kind of notification of kernel ignoring the pause). But you are right, we can definitely re-visit this if we see any resistance or complaints.\r\nAgain, thanks a lot of reviewing and providing great feedbacks.",

Perhaps that would trigger reviews from appropriate maintainers.\r\n\r\nThis seems generally useful. I'm curious what happens if the user tries to interrupt, restart, or, more importantly, shutdown a paused kernel?  Seems like these operations would behave as if they're ignored relative to the kernel, but the server doesn't know that.  I would think shutdown, for example, would likely remove the kernel from its list of kernels, and be lost for subsequent interactions (yet, still be \"running\").  Similarly, restart consists of shutdown and startup; so the shutdown wouldn't really happen, while the startup would, essentially leaking a kernel process.\r\n\r\nLikewise, what happens when cells are sent to paused kernels?  \r\n\r\nThanks.",
