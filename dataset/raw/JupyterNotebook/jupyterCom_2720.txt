What you want is some kind of parallel computing; there are many frameworks for that - [ipyparallel](http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is one that lives under the Jupyter umbrella.\r\n\r\nIt's a complicated problem, because the computer has to work out how to divide up the data and the tasks efficiently. Different tools expose different levels of control. Whole books have been written about this.",
