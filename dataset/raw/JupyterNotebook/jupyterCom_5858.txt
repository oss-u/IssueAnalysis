    "body": "I'm not sure what you mean by \"remote machine\" as the output presented appears as though `<ctrl-c>` (SIGINT) is being issued from the command line.  That said, I don't think that is necessarily germane.\r\n\r\nIt sure looks like the initial interrupt occurred at an odd spot such that the signal handlers/event loop are in an inconsistent state of sorts.  You might try the following...\r\n\r\n1. Does `jupyter notebook list` return any entries?  If so, try `jupyter notebook stop`.  \"list\" merely reads a file that was produced on the previous startup, but I'm wondering if the interrupt came in prior to that file's creation.\r\n2. Use `ps` to identify the notebook process ID (pid) and issue `kill pid`.  If that `kill` doesn't work, issue the same command with `-9` (e.g., `kill -9 pid`) since that sends a more forceful signal (SIGKILL vs SIGTERM).\r\n\r\nTo trim the `ps` output, pipe the output to `grep notebook` (e.g., `ps ax | grep notebook` and the pid is the first column).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regarding the location in the startup sequence in which the original interrupt occurred, that is extremely early.  Did things appear as though they were hung up?  In trying to reproduce issuing a SIGINT that early, it was very difficult - within seconds of issuing the command - so I'm wondering if that's a hint as why your process ended up in this state in the first place._",
