Then, something happens (I don't know what) and I only see something like <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x28e5a4a8> instead of the plots. If I replot them, then they are normally displayed but once I close the notebook and reopen it, they again are not displayed. I thus have to recreate the notebook from scratch for it to work again. Note that I am using  the following for plotting:\n%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\n\nI am using Firefox 32-bit (just realized that it is the 32-bit version while my machine is 64-bit).\nI experienced this problem for quite some time. In the beginning I was using no extensions. Now I use several extensions : execute time, (some) LaTeX environment, scratchpad, autosavetime, codefolding, initialization cells, collapsible headings and table of contents (2).\n\nI will try on Chrome to see if anything changes.\n",

Are you running it on different computers, synchronised by something like Dropbox or Github?\n\nOutput formats like HTML and SVG are able to send code to the kernel to execute, so we have to be careful about displaying them, because it's a security risk. If a notebook is recognised as one that you have run all of and saved on this computer before, it is _trusted_, and those outputs are displayed. If any of the outputs weren't generated and saved on this computer, it's untrusted, and you can't see potentially dangerous outputs.\n\nPossible workarounds:\n- Use PNG plots - PNGs can't send code to the kernel (except potentially by exploiting browser bugs), so they don't need to be trusted.\n- If you're sure of where the notebook came from, you can manually mark it as trusted in the file menu.\n",
