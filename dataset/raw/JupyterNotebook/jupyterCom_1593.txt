    "body": "thank you!\r\n\r\ni’m sorry but i think it was a mistake that you didn’t write API docs from the very start, even if it wasn’t to become stable anytime soon. kernel.js and nbextensions and rely on the JS API, but without a friendly environment (docs & a discussion platform), most potential plugin developers were probably scared off.\r\n\r\nsorry at this point to derail the thread even further, i’ll stop ASAP, but one last question: i’m not familiar with jupyterlab. is there a (at least semi-)stable JS API in development alongside the rest? if not, we should immediately start. i’m happy to help.",

Part of the aim was to convey that it wasn't stable, but you need plugin developers to work out what the API should be.\r\n\r\nI believe that part of the plan for Jupyterlab is a reliable JS API, but I don't know what it is or where to point you.",
