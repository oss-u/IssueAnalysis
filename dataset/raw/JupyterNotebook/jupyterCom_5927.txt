    "body": "The ssl options are configurable via `NotebookApp.ssl_options`...\r\n```\r\n--NotebookApp.ssl_options=<key-1>=<value-1>...\r\n    Supply SSL options for the tornado HTTPServer. See the tornado docs for\r\n    details.\r\n```\r\nand adjustments to `ssl_version` are discussed in #3790.  E.g., looks like `--NotebookApp.ssl_options=ssl_version=5` would get you TLS v1.2.  However, given this option maps to a dictionary, it probably makes more sense to use the configuration file format shown in the referenced issue since the CLI format is a bit awkward.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend upgrading your notebook version.\r\n\r\nClosing.",
