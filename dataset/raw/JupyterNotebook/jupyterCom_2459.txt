    "body": "I see this locally as well. It seems the `cell-tag` class needs `white-space: nowrap;` in order to avoid the X's disappearing. I can PR this.\r\n\r\nThe cell toolbar has a fixed size of 29 pixels, which is why it does not wrap the tags on overflow (the control heights are inherited as well). This was the case from before tags PR, I simply went along with it without asking any questions. Since the tags cannot overflow, the \"[...]\" button was added (along with a fade out of the tags to help indicate this, which can be seen with the nowrap style). See the original PR (#2048) for this discussion. Currently the \"[...]\" is visible all the time, but it might be possible to engineer some JS/CSS to make it only appear on overflow, which might be a better UX clue to its purpose.",
