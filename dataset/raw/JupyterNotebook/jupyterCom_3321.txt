    "body": "Thanks! It largely feels like trial and error, but to break down some specific issues:\r\n\r\n- For some reason, passing `--NotebookApp.base_url /a@b/` failed on Travis. After talking with Matthias, I tried on a whim passing it as `--NotebookApp.base_url=/a@b/`, which appears to work.\r\n- There were some SSL errors connecting to Sauce to drive the browser. After some frustration, I found a SO post saying that you have to use plain http rather than https.\r\n- Then I wasn't specifying a browser to use. Thankfully Sauce gave me a helpful error message, so that was easy.\r\n- Excluding a directory from nose proved to be surprisingly hard. Nose has options `--exclude` and `--ignore-files`, which are documented as taking a regex, but aren't very specific about what string the regex will be applied to. I finally decided that it's only possible with a plugin called `nose-exclude`.\r\n- Now Travis complains that it can't find geckodriver, so I'll copy and update [some code](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7068#issuecomment-268692519) to install it.",

Within the testing scripts I just wait for that 'spinner' to be gone to signify that the kernel has finished and the page has updated with the results from the kernel. It has worked quite well thus far.\r\n\r\nGranted, my lil ol package is nothing compared to the mammoth of the Jupyter Notebook project, but I thought you might like to know how my experience was.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSimon",
