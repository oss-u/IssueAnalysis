    "body": "Very cool tool, though for me the best of this kind remains [LyX](http://www.lyx.org). It lets you combine typing LaTeX that gets auto-rendered (like MathQuill) with having command palettes for more esoteric stuff you may not know/remember how to type in LaTeX.  \n\nThat makes it incredibly powerful: if you know the commands, you just type along and it simply \"compiles on the fly\" to WYSIWYM (\"What you see is what you mean\", i.e. close enough visually to the final LaTeX render to be useful, but not pixel-perfect so it can be done on the fly without a full LaTeX call). But if you don't know something, you can use the palettes to visually create the piece you are missing.  When I was doing lots more complex mathematical writing, it saved me endless amounts of poring over LaTeX docs, and I even used it often to answer colleagues' questions about how to do something in LaTeX: I would just open LyX, type/build up what they needed, and then view the raw LaTeX (which it will show you if you want) for the answer to copy/paste into a raw `.tex` file.\n\nI've yet to find a system for math editing that I like better than LyX.\n",
