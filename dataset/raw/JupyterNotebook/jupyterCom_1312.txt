If we persist it, people will use it once and forget it. At which point I agree that the toolbar is likely not necessary. If we don't persist it and keep it as an instance variable. some users will likely use it every time they open the notebook. \n\nLastly, It was one of the most requested feature at JupyterDays, which make me think that – in the case we don't persist it to nbconfig – a visible UI element for it seem likely useful.\n",
