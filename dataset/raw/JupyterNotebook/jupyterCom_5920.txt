I'll add that if we're going to move the floor of tornado, I recommend moving to `>= 6.1` (similar to `jupyter_server`) so as to \"capture\" the tornado update for the Windows event loop policy.

The bump of `tornado` was to prevent others from running into this issue after upgrading to 6.1.6.  \r\n\r\nI agree, anyone with additional `tornado` dependencies will need to figure out the path of least resistance - which you have done.  Thank you for spelling those out for others in the same boat.",
