    "body": "OK, I'm assuming that the webbrowser module is calling `xdg-open`, while is a wrapper around the desktop's open command (e.g. `gio open ...` on GNOME), and that calling that with a `file://` URL is equivalent to calling it with a path, so it opens the .html file with the default handler.\r\n\r\nCan you both check `import webbrowser; webbrowser.get().name`?\r\n\r\nI haven't thought of any good way to avoid this, given that launching with `file://` URL is a nice security improvement. Probably the best we can do is try to detect that the default browser is something like `xdg-open` and override the normal logic to find a browser. The downside is that we may launch the 'wrong' browser, not the default the user has configured in their system, in cases where we currently get the right one. But it should at least ensure that most users get a browser rather than an editor.\r\n\r\nOf course, with problems like this it's always tempting to add a config option to 'do it the old way'. I'm trying to avoid that. Settings shouldn't make it too easy to remove security, because in a few years people will follow instructions they find to change the setting without understanding the implications. You can already solve this problem with configuration by setting e.g. `c.NotebookApp.browser = 'firefox'`. So it's only about how to handle the default, unconfigured case.\r\n\r\nAny better ideas before I start trying to code a workaround?\r\n\r\n",
