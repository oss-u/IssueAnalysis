Large outputs that include things like images don't generally cause problems. They may be slow on poor networks, but throttling probably isn't going to be helpful in those cases.\r\n\r\nThe main output type that is helped by the data limit is stream output. (a few MB of stdout can cause major issues, whereas a few MB image is generally no problem). One option is to apply the data-rate limit exclusively to stream outputs.",
