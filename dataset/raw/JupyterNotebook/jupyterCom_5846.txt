    "body": "This message is stating that the kernel cannot find the `master_list` variable in its set of definitions.  If the kernel was just restarted and the initialization of `master_list` occurs in a previous cell, you would get this error as if `master_list` is not defined.  Be sure to execute a cell that initializes `master_list` prior to executing the `print(master_list)` cell within the same lifecycle of the kernel.\r\n\r\nSince this is not an issue with this repository, I'm closing for now.  Feel free to report your status as a comment on this issue as that might help others as well.",
