    "body": "It's tough to determine what to recommend since you haven't indicated what you've tried.  \r\n\r\nThis issue (`win32api: %1 is not a valid Win32 application`) appears to be mostly related to running 64bit DLLs on 32bit systems.  I would look at things through that lens in terms of your Anaconda installation, etc.  Also, I see a mixture of paths coming into play.  For instance, `C:\\Users\\susha\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python38\\site-packages` then `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\lib` and perhaps its the case that one env is introducing the incompatibility?  Since others appear to have resolved this issue following https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4909#issuecomment-596876786, I would recommend performing those actions if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nPlease respond with any findings you have as this appears to be one of the more difficult situations to resolve.",
