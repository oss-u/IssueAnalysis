I would there were a way to execute some code in Javascript.\n\nMy **guess** is that the minifying process detect that custom is not used and basically strip it out, move it later or whatever. So actually **using** custom might fix things. \n\nAlso I think it woudl be less brittle to actually define a `load` function in custom js which get call at a point in the code that we can control. Not Execute code at whatever point in time where custom.js is seen by the VM. \n",

I suspect the issue is that minification changed the load times relevant to the race condition, since all the modules other than custom.js are immediately available as part of the single `main.min.js` request, and custom.js is the only one that requires later loading.\n",
