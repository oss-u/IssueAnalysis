    "body": "It would also be handy to expose the cell index in the GUI (perhaps via a mouse over). I have mentioned before that it is difficult to refer to cells in classroom discussions (for example, before execution, there is no identifier). And, since cell execution numbers change with execution (and re-execution), using those as references can be confusing. Making the cell index more obvious is not completely immune of such issues (ordering can change) but for referencing, cell index is more stable.",
