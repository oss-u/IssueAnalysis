The `headercontainer` block is empty in the default `page.html` template, so this should be harmless in the default case.\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious to me that there's a 'right' place in the overridden template blocks to put the `super()`. It looks like for your use case, adding stuff somewhere in the middle works, but that may not be right for everything. Perhaps this points to a need for more fine-grained blocks - maybe header-left and header-right, for instance. I'm sure template designers have established ideas about how to do this kind of thing, but I don't know them. :-)",
