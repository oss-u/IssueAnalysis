My tornado must have gotten updated with older pip versions that were updating all dependencies. So in a way this is a symptom of the change in behavior of pip. If you consistently used pip<10, things are going to be fine 'cause you'll get all the new dependencies, and if you use new pip>10 from the start things will be fine because these dependencies will all remain at their older versions. In any case, given that this pip transition is ongoing, it does seem reasonable to bump the requirements and make it works regardless of pip version changes.",
