<s> until we are more ready to emphasize it . lab 's still there , you just have to enter the url for now . cc <user > <user > <user > <user > </s>
<s> i appreciate your point , but i really think this is the wrong thing to do . it 's clearly marked as alpha - is there something specific that you'd like to see before calling it alpha ? </s>
<s> i 'm comfortable either way , since it 's on master - it depends on how many people run on master . either way , <user > also suggested we have a very visible notice of what to expect and what wo n't work . </s>
<s> the other factor in the decision for me is how close we are to releasing notebook master as a new release . if it 's soon , then not having the button makes sense to me . if it will be a while , enough so we can get the notebook working " minimally " , then i think the button is fine . </s>
<s> but to <user > 's point - let 's have a meeting between everyone to draw the feature line for when it 's <unka'> for beta testing , etc . </s>
<s> we definitely are n't close to releasing 5.0 . we 've just had several complaints already suggesting that the button either should n't be there , or should be significantly less prominent , at least until lab can actually be used for something ( basic notebook execution ). </s>
<s> it can currently be used to edit text , run terminals , and do file system operations . basic notebook execution also works , but with a reduced subset of functionality ( if we remove the read-only restriction ). </s>
<s> there are people running on master , complaining that a <unka-> alpha version of <unka-> code does not work perfectly ? </s>
<s> no , there are people complaining that an extremely prominent link that says " try me !" does n't do the one thing they care about using jupyter for : write , edit , and execute notebooks , and there 's no information <unka> that they should n't expect it to do so . </s>
<s> these are developers running from master though , and the button says " try " and " alpha " . i do n't see why this is a problem . </s>
<s> i do n't see why delaying the introduction of a button is a problem , either . </s>
<s> would sticking it at the bottom of the page for now and tweaking the wording ( not exactly sure how , but something less encouraging than 'try me' ) be an acceptable compromise ? </s>
<s> i think the best thing to do is get everyone on a video chat , as jason suggested , otherwise this pr conversation will quickly become <unka> :) </s>
<s> i think we all agree that there should at least be a prominent notice about what to expect ( a modal when the page starts , or a tab on the <unka> , or a notice at the top of the page , or something ). </s>
<s> good point <user > - there 's likely a compromise somewhere . i think we should n't <unka-> this too much either . </s>
<s> note that currently it does n't even execute or edit notebooks . so the main functionality of the notebook does n't actually work at all . it 's ok to push out alpha tools , but the current state is n't quite at alpha functionality yet , and we run the risk of simply turn users away . i think we need to introduce it gradually . as we gain more functionality , we can display it more <unka> , but right now we basically need <unka/> feedback , it 's not really something people can " try " in the sense of using it as a notebook , even for 5 minutes . so i think we need : - initially a <unka-> invitation , just so it 's easy to find it for someone who actually wants to help test . we can email the list for now to invite people to try it out . <user > 's suggestion is a good one . to keep it simple , we could make it a plain text link for now ( to avoid <unka-> work ); once it <unka> we can use the nice " try me " button . - an information page that tells people roughly what to expect . right now , they might assume that it 's an actual notebook , and think the lack of execution ( a most basic feature to do anything useful ) is missing might be a bug . we do n't want that reported , so people need to know what 's to be expected as working and what they should report as a bug . - as we add features , we can move the invitation to be more prominent , changing the plain text link to be the nicer button at the top . and yes , i 'm a developer ( sort of :) who runs off master and tried it , but i was immediately confused by the lack of execution , which i thought was a bug as i would expect that it would at least let me do <unka_> with the notebooks . so if <unka_> had that reaction , we should assume that it can happen to others too and act accordingly . </s>
<s> i 'm going to jump on the " let 's have a call about this " train . the current state is a product of joint decisions between my team and the jupyter core team , so clearly something was lost in translation . </s>
<s> unfortunately i have a string of meetings today . but i had a chance to discuss this with <user > yesterday by <unka> , he might be able to channel my thoughts , as it seems i failed to do so in the thread ... </s>
<s> i do n't think anything was lost in translation ( i.e ., we did exactly what we had planned and had decided on ). what happened is that we got feedback and now we're adjusting in response to that helpful feedback . </s>
<s> +1 on lowering the visibility of the button . it 's far from matching the theme of the current ui , feel ( to me ) like someone yelling at me in upper case letter . i do n't think having a " lab " button of the page is a bad thing . i think the style , location and visibility are just inappropriate . </s>
<s> i 'm fine with adapting style and adding <unka> , but i think hiding it altogether is a <unka-> reaction . basic execution in the notebook <unka_> work , but we were specifically asked by min to make it read-only because it does n't support <unka_> output types yet . the point of the button is to <unka> feedback from bleeding edge developers , and hiding it will limit that feedback . i 'm not suggesting it be rolled out in a user release at this point . </s>
<s> agreed it might be too much . the all point of master is to get feedback from bleeding edge developer . the lab page is not the only one that get update and need feedback and have no reason to get special treatment . plus it <unka> all users that are running on master instead of just advanced developer who are the one we seek feedback from . the master branch is also useful to see how people discover things in the ui , and if the interaction with the ui is seamless and feature discoverable . adding a flashy button which main point is to be removed later , have a complete opposite effect of what is desired , and target the wrong kind of individual thus makes no sens to me . </s>
<s> these two statements seem contradictory to me . is there a better branch than master which targets only bleeding edge developers who can tolerate <unka-> ? </s>
<s> i 'm fine with the button , i just heard from a few directions that maybe it was a little premature to have it there . sorry for starting this mess . </s>
<s> <user > - thanks for moving on the feedback , though . it sounds like fernando 's proposal is a good way forward . </s>
<s> i brought this up to <user > and this was his first time seeing the button integrated in the ui . here 's how it looks now : <unka<> > he ( and i ) think this looks better : <unka<> > </s>
<s> another idea , we could ask <user > to reduce the orange in the button , so it 's not as focus grabbing . </s>
<s> <user > would it be possible to make a default panel in the lab setup that tells people about the lab interface ? </s>
<s> i also like <user > 's plain text link idea edit : <user > 's suggestion </s>
<s> <user > yep - great idea , we can have an " about " tab or something with that info . just need the text/html people want to put in it . </s>
<s> go ahead and make the about tab with the text " this is <unka> !" , then i 'll merge it and can submit a pr with better text in it after . <unka<> > </s>
<s> <user > ^ </s>
<s> no . we <unka> to keep master usable at all time to get feedback from most of the community . by bleeding edge developer i mean developer that are running the bleeding edge version . you should n't need to have 36 years of experience in python and typescript to run master . so yes on master you have a lot of user that are not even experienced with git and just know how to do git pull . if you put a big orange button you can expect to get testing ( mostly ) from these . if you want feedback from advance developers , you make a feature which is relatively hard to reach , hidden behind a config option , or a non obvious link and advertise it on twitter , the mailing list . or even just a message in the js console . </s>
<s> <user > , see <url > </s>
<s> as one of the people who said that we should consider making <unka/`> and <unka/`> two separate projects ( one has to keep the old apis , one has their continued green field engineering ), i thank <user > for kicking off this discussion . it had to happen , as a lot of people were fairly minimal in their responses ( not wanting to spend too much <unka/> <unka> it ). <unka<> > i was fairly quiet in the past of just accepting that " this is what we decided , there is no <unka> " the <unka> interface is very slick and responsive ( with some edges that i 'm sure will get cleaned up ) and people want a way to <unka> it . the cool thing is we can keep moving and disappearing the button every day until we're happy . consensus is in the code . </s>
<s> ( sticks neck out ) any support for making the button more like the existing tabs on the dashboard page already ? i know it 's not a true tab , but if it appeared in the tab row , maybe right aligned away from the other tabs , it would fit with the existing ui , still be noticeable enough for people to click it , and could contain any amount of text required to express its <unka-/> nature . </s>
<s> i like this idea . </s>
<s> interesting idea , but i do n't think it 's great ux to have something that looks like a tab but does n't behave like one ( i.e . it does something other than switching the view in the tab content area ). </s>
<s> <unka<> > <user > is right , it 's a nice idea for not having it so visible , but is the wrong interaction . a smaller button , possibly moved to a different place would be better . </s>
<s> while this is an open topic , what 's the approach an admin of a jupyter 5.0 deployment should take to disable hide the try button until he/she is ready to expose and support the new lab interface ? is there a command line feature flag ? does the admin have to provide custom css template for the dashboard page ? </s>
<s> good question , i do n't think we had anything planned in advance . it should be relatively easy to add a serverside flag . </s>
<s> what if we just took away the " try " and the orange accent on the button and made it more subtle . also , the " try " is probably implied because of the " alpha release " text under the title . <unka<> > </s>
<s> <user > that makes it look like the dashboard is <unka> </s>
<s> <user > yeah i was thinking of that too :/ </s>
<s> i do like how subtle the button is there <user > - it fits the current ui very well . without the try , i think that 's how it makes it look like a brand on the notebook dashboard . </s>
<s> what if we got away from that button and just put a dropdown arrow next to the jupyter dashboard logo . when you click on it , it reveals a menu that lets you get to the <unka> dashboard ( aka just the app itself ) <unka<> > <unka<> > or even just having the <unka> icon : <unka<> > </s>
<s> i like that last option a lot : easy to find for someone who needs it , less likely to catch the <unka> :) and btw : i want to reiterate this was n't a slight at all on the original work ! i think it 's great to have <unka> more easily accessible , so we can provide feedback and iterate . consider this round 1 of that feedback . i also love the stronger button , which we can use later on when things are more functional , and we're willing to start <unka> more folks . now , one thing i think is very important is to provide a very obvious information page that sets expectations for users who do open it . for example , telling them that right now the notebook tab is read-only . otherwise people are just likely to be confused . our project has a tradition of master being bleeding edge but basically usable , and i see no reason to deviate from that . but as long as we communicate clearly what we expect to work and what not , we can get feedback this way . if nothing else , that 's critical to get usable reports , otherwise we're just going to get a bunch of people filing bugs that say " the notebook does n't run " , and we 'll spend our time closing them as false positives . thanks again ! </s>
<s> this is already much better in master : <unka<> > </s>
<s> ah , great ! i had n't pulled so i <unka'> noticed that . many , many thanks !! </s>
<s> <unka<> > noice ! </s>
